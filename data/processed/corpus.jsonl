By the time I was a teenager, the streets had become my classroom. Violence was normal. Fear was constant. And in 1991, at nineteen years old, I made a decision that would change my life forever. I shot and killed a man. For that, I was sentenced to seventeen to forty years in prison. I ended up serving nineteen—seven of them in solitary confinement. Prison is designed to break you. The walls, the rules, the routine—it’s all meant to strip you down until you forget who you are. But what I discovered is that the most powerful prisons aren’t the ones made of concrete and steel. They’re the ones we carry with 4 \fus—built from grief, anger, shame, trauma, and self-doubt. The ones that keep us stuck, even when the door is wide open. And here’s what I’ve learned: prisons have doors. And those doors can be opened. I walked out of prison in 2010 into a world where people like me were expected to fail. Where 67.8% of men who had served time would be back behind bars within three years. But I refused to be a statistic. Instead, I became a student of freedom—not just physical freedom, but mental, emotional, and spiritual freedom. What I learned inside those walls wasn’t just how to survive—I learned how to rebuild, adapt, and overcome. And over the years, I’ve developed a deep understanding of resilience—not just as an idea, but as a practice. Today, I teach that practice to others. Executives, founders, athletes, and world-class leaders come to me—not because they’ve been to prison, but because they feel trapped. 5 \fSome are battling imposter syndrome, questioning whether they truly belong in the rooms in which they’ve earned a seat. Some are entrepreneurs frozen by self-doubt, afraid to take the risks that lead to success. Others are parents trapped by perfectionism, struggling under the weight of expectations. And that’s when I remind them of the truth: Everyone has hidden prisons. But every prison has a door. As a resilience expert, my work is rooted in helping people break free—whether from past mistakes, limiting beliefs, or selfimposed barriers. Over the years, I’ve developed a framework that has helped leaders, creators, and innovators build lives of clarity, purpose, and impact. This book is about that framework. Through raw storytelling and hard-won experience, I’ll show you how to design your own freedom ecosystem—using strategic mindfulness, emotional regulation, and purposeful boundary-setting to break free from whatever is holding you back. These aren’t 6 \fabstract theories. They’re battle-tested tools, forged in the hardest conditions imaginable. One of my core mantras is simple but powerful: “I don’t have to wait to be free. I am free right now. I am free from the weight of my past. I don’t owe my old mistakes my future.” This is not just another personal development book. It’s a blueprint—a guide for anyone ready to step into the life they were meant to live. Let’s get free. 7 \fIntroduction \"He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.\" – Muhammad Ali The words \"parole denied\" sat at the top of the paper I held in my hand, mocking me with this second denial. Sitting on the edge of my bunk, my perch for eighteen years, I was caught in what felt like an endless loop of confinement and disappointment. I had grown up here, transformed from rebel to writer, witnessed some friends die, some lose their mental grip, and others leave and come back. Would they ever let me out of this place? My body tensed as I held back tears. Emotions rolled through me in waves — sadness flowing into the familiarity of anger, the kind that threatened to overtake the little hope I had left. I had ticked every box, followed the Department of Corrections' criteria for release, and evolved in ways no one would have imagined possible. In the first five 8 \fyears I had been labeled the worst of the worst, but now I was a mentor, tutor and writer. Back at square one, it was like being sentenced all over again. But as I sat there, enveloped in the familiar hurricane of disappointment, a realization slowly dawned on me. I had a choice. This moment, as heartbreaking as it was, presented me with two options. I could succumb to depression, let it drag me down into that dark place of hopelessness from which there seemed no escape, or I could stand firm on the hope that had already carried me over many troubled waters and use this setback as an opportunity to prepare myself for the next hearing, and ultimately, for my freedom. As Marcus Aurelius wrote in Meditations, “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” This perfectly captured the transformative work I’d been engaged in for years—the work of freeing the mind, body, and soul. It was work that challenged me to embrace the present moment as both a gift and an opportunity. It’s work we all have the capacity to do. My parole denial was an obstacle to my freedom, but within that moment lay the path forward. 9 \fI came out of that moment with renewed focus and determination. When the yard opened, I called my dad and broke the news to him. Then I walked the yard with a friend from the neighborhood and talked about what I was going to do when they released me. When the third parole hearing finally arrived, I stood before the board not just as a man seeking freedom, but as one who had already freed himself internally. I was battered and bruised, but still standing. The moment I received the paperwork stamped \"parole granted,\" it was not just a release from physical confinement, but a validation and manifestation of the journey I had undertaken. It was finally time for me to return to my city, community and family. In that moment, I realized I’d been in prison before I’d ever been arrested, and I’d broken free long before the parole board saw fit to release me. I had defied the odds, narrowly escaping the expected outcome of a kid serving a 17–40-year sentence for murder. It had been two decades since I’d last walked on free soil, unburdened by handcuffs and shackles. Despite scars from an officer nearly breaking 10 \fmy arm, an unhealed ACL tear from another encounter, and a bad back, my sanity, spiritual well-being, and integrity remained largely intact. Still, I struggled with feelings of self-doubt and worthlessness—vulnerabilities that could have been imperiled by release. As I write, that was fifteen years ago, and the battle with those imprisoning voices has been a long war. What I have come to understand is that true freedom is a journey, not a destination. Today, through my work as an author, speaker, and entrepreneur-things I dreamed about both before and during my incarceration--I have met countless individuals grappling with their own relentless inner and outer imprisoning voices: Prisons of grief, anger, shame and the inability to forgive. At book signings, after keynote speeches or fireside chats, people share how my story helped them get through a divorce, get over the suicide of a child, or take the next step in their careers. People of every race, creed and gender, expressing deep gratitude for being released from something that was holding them back. Regardless of our individual journeys, survivor's remorse, 11 \ftrauma, and guilt are common struggles that stand in the way of becoming the individuals we aspire to be. Everyone has a prison. That's precisely why I wanted to write this book—to oﬀer skills that can help people break free from the emotional, psychological and metaphorical prisons, both seen and unseen, that confine them. While some of us have experienced physical incarceration, many others find themselves trapped by circumstances, serving time handed down from a diﬃcult childhood, horrible work experiences, heartbreak and traumatic events or confined behind invisible bars that exist in their minds. Now, as I sit here in my oﬃce, I look at my life, the people I love, the experiences I am blessed to have, and the way I move through the world with presence and awareness, and I feel my heart aligns with something greater: love, joy, purpose and healing, for myself and for others. I have finally become all the things I once imagined myself to be years ago. An artist, an entrepreneur, a father and a husband. My only concern now is fighting for the deeper parts of my soul, and the souls of people who deserve love, laughter, 12 \fappreciation, and the freedom to just be. Each of us has a liberating purpose and my hope is that you will receive these lessons and more importantly that you will grow to know that you are worth fighting for, and that you are worthy of your freedom. What’s in front of us is more important than what’s behind us. On June 22, 2023, just a day after my fifty-first birthday and thirteen years since my release from prison, my brother and I were invited to the Porsche Driving Experience in Carson, California. We arrived at a large modern facility fronted by a vibrant assortment of Porsches, both modern and impeccably preserved vintage models reminiscent of the scaled-down race cars we had played with as kids. If there was a paradise for gearheads, grease monkeys and car enthusiasts, this was unquestionably it. By a stroke of luck, my instructor happened to be a fellow Michigan native, and his welcoming charm reminded me of home. We quickly caught up on all things Detroit and Michigan before stepping outside to check out the two cars I would be driving. The first was a 13 \fsleek yellow 911 GT3, a beautiful beast that blended track-focused capabilities with street-legal practicality. The second was a beautiful burgundy 911 Turbo, that did 0-60 in 2.7 seconds and had no problem pinning my body to the seat. I hopped into the passenger seat of the yellow 911, and we set off onto the track. We practiced oversteering exercises, going over techniques to recover from a spin. The key was keeping your eyes on where you wanted to go, rather than what you were afraid of hitting. Then we switched seats, and it was my turn to navigate the short water-slicked track. After a few spinouts, I finally mastered the maneuver, and I was allowed to launch the Porsche as fast as I could. But the real point of the exercise was still ahead of us. We headed over to the main track. Covering the rearview mirror, the instructor told me \"I own this mirror, and you have to trust me.\" Sensing my hesitation, he went on to explain his experience as a professional and stunt driver for over fifteen years. He had encountered every possible scenario on the track and witnessed the consequences of drivers fixating on what was behind them rather than focusing on their intended path. He emphasized that my sole 14 \fobjective on the track should be to concentrate on where I wanted to go. As I took off, a small voice said to me, “Your past doesn’t define your path! If I genuinely desired to push my heart to the edge by driving this car to its limit, I had to trust my instructor, knowing he had already done all the groundwork. That is what I’m asking of you: to trust me, knowing that I, too, have already done the groundwork. I have overcome trauma, grief, guilt and physical incarceration. I have succeeded beyond anyone’s expectations of what was possible for me. I have beat the odds, overcome heartbreak and developed a deep and profound understanding of the power of forgiveness, both of myself and of others. My hope as we embark together on this journey toward personal freedom, is that you will allow me to take the mirror, while you take the steering wheel. Let’s get free! 15 \fChapter One Grief I don’t want to write this down I wanna tell you how I feel right now - Mos Def I stared at the tip of the pen as it pressed into the paper. It was the morning of January 1st, 2021. My goal was simple: set my intentions for the year. It was a practice I had adopted while sitting in a prison cell two decades prior. Writing down the things I desired to manifest in my life had become a consistent practice. However, that day, instead of writing about the future, I was ruminating on the previous year. So many things had changed. My son Sekou and I had moved into our new home, just five months before the US shut down due to Covid. While navigating homeschooling and remote work, we got a pandemic puppy we named Indyego, and I met an amazing woman named Liz. That spring of 2021, as the moldy grey clouds of winter started to lift, I flew my dad and stepmom out from Detroit to visit me in LA. It 16 \fwas our first time seeing one another in person since the beginning of the pandemic, and their first time ever visiting the city. It was heaven. We had lengthy conversations and cocktails by the backyard fire pit, my dad and I swam in our pool, we visited the Santa Monica Pier, and enjoyed meals together. We went to the California African American Museum, where I was honored to be part of an exhibit called \"Men of Courage,\" alongside figures like LeBron James, Ryan Coogler and Kendrick Lamar. I told them about my new love interest, and that I was excited to finally meet her in person. “Son, a big part of being in a relationship is learning how to receive your significant other’s unique way of loving you. If you communicate the way you desire to be loved and are open to them loving you in their way, you will be okay, for the most part”, he said. My dad often ended his philosophical musings with “for the most part.” I took it to mean that things in a relationship won’t always be one hundred percent positive, but that we will be okay as long as we accept this reality. The following month, Liz and I were about to meet in person and travel together for the first time. We had been introduced by our 17 \fmutual friend Trabian in December 2020, through a call that we would later learn we were both reluctant to join. Our conversation flowed effortlessly, and we started talking nightly until we decided to meet in person. Liz flew to LA, and the following day we drove up north to Half Moon Bay, where we spent a few days hanging out, laughing, eating saltwater taffy and getting to know one another. We continued our daily calls after Liz headed back to Chicago, and then she returned to help me celebrate my birthday and my homecoming anniversary in June. I was excited to introduce Liz to more of my friends and nervous about sharing my art with her. I got to do both when my friends Ben and Felicia hosted a reading of my new book. Despite my nerves,I was happy she was able to see me doing what I loved, and proud she was there for a standing ovation. We had an incredible time, and I was on top of the world. My work was going well, Sekou was thriving in life and school, my art was evolving, and my heart had been opened to love again. I was on top of the world. 18 \fThen, on July 12th, I received a call from my father about my brother. “Sherrod was found shot to death in the kitchen of a house on the westside,” he said, his voice cracking. Everything seemed to freeze in that moment—even the music playing in the background. The air was snatched from my lungs, and I couldn’t bring myself to utter a word. My fingers and the phone felt like ice blocks. “Sherrod is dead,” he managed to get out as his voice descended into a wail that sent chills through my body. The last time I’d seen Sherrod, we’d stood talking outside of Detroit’s Masonic Temple, a magnificent and elegant building that stretched across Third Street, like a perfectly executed Grand Jeté. The frigid November wind whipped around us as we did our best to catch up on everything that had transpired since we’d last seen each other. We talked often by phone, but my life in LA had gotten pretty busy, making it harder to get back to Detroit as often as I wanted to. He had been in prison as well and his parole made it impossible for him to come and see me in LA. Sherrod was my stepbrother. We’d met in 1985 when our parents first started dating. He was the youngest of three, and I was 19 \fthe fourth of six. When five years later our parents married, I went from having five siblings to having eight. I was excited to have them: my older stepbrother Kidd, my older stepsister Vanessa, and my new little brother Sherrod. Vanessa and I had the classic teenage tension, but we quickly grew to be best friends. We fought over the phone and made up over the music, fast food and weed we hid from our parents. Kidd and I connected over sports, and even though we didn’t talk a lot growing up, we developed a bond and mutual respect through letters when I went to prison. With Sherrod it was different from the beginning. When our parents first got together, he was a chubby, shy elementary school kid, and I was excited to finally have a baby brother. I couldn’t wait to teach him how to fight the neighborhood bullies, hold his own on the basketball court and talk to girls. But there was a big problem: Sherrod wasn’t interested in any of the things I was interested in. Instead, he wanted to eat snacks and play video games. He became the typical annoying little brother. 20 \fSherrod was a pre-teen by the time our parents married, and I was sentenced to prison shortly thereafter. I was heartbroken to leave him behind. About six years into my sentence, he wrote that he was thinking of me because he was wearing a coat I had sent home from prison. His letter touched me profoundly, showing me the void I had left in my family’s life. When I was finally released, I was excited to reconnect with Sherrod and my other siblings, but shortly after I got home Sherrod was sentenced to eight years in prison for shooting three people. They were from our neighborhood—they’d grown up just down the street. They had attacked Sherrod and his girlfriend, beating them both when he refused to give them money. He got a gun, went back down the street, shot and injured all three of them. I went to his sentencing and couldn’t help thinking that I somehow had failed to keep him out of the system. Over the years I had sent letters home urging the young men in my family and neighborhood not to make the same poor decisions I had. “Don’t let a 21 \fthirty-second decision become a life sentence,” I would often write, repeating what I had heard in the prison yard over the years. Now here I was imagining Sherrod going through the hell I had just broken free from. The thought of the strip searches, the violence and indignity of it all was heartbreaking. I tried to keep my composure, and I promised Sherrod I would be there for him and make sure he made the best of his time. My hard time inside had earned me friends and relationships at the same prison where he now was. I knew I could rely on to keep my brother safe and on the right track. Throughout his incarceration, I sent him books that had inspired me: As a Man Thinketh, Think and Grow Rich, The Secret, and books about Black artists, entrepreneurs and historic figures. I also made sure he had great mentors and encouraged him to take advantage of whatever classes were being offered. He wrote me often, and I was impressed with his intellectual growth and perspective. Through our letters and phone calls, he shared things we’d never been able to discuss before: his parents’ divorce, our parents' marriage, and all the feelings those experiences evoked. Our parents never talked to us 22 \fabout any of these things -- they just threw us all together and hoped for the best. Our parents’ generation gave birth to the words, “fuck them kids,” something we joke and laugh about today. So, we found and fought our way from being stepsiblings to full-on siblings. Eventually, there was no distinction, we were simply family. I promised Sherrod that I would come to see him, but it was years before my visit was approved by the prison administration, despite us being family. One day Sherrod called to tell me he was taking a class and the textbook they were using had included some excerpts of writings I done while in prison. His excitement and pride were palpable, and I told him that it meant the world to me that my words were being used to help imprisoned men find their own voices. I also told him about the challenges of buying a house, what it was like hustling books, and making my way legally. We even laughed about my experiences with some of the foods I had discovered since being home, like sushi, octopus and wagyu. Anytime he saw me on TV or read about me in a publication he had access to, he would find a way to get in touch simply to let me know it 23 \fmade him more determined to do the right thing when he came home. I was so excited for his homecoming. I wanted to share my adventures with him. I wanted him to see the ocean and be blown away the way I had been the first time I saw it. I wanted him to travel abroad, eat weird foods and find his own sense of peace and purpose, the way I had found mine. We even talked about him joining me out in LA once he got off parole. True to his word Sherrod stayed focused on his education. He earned his associate’s degree in prison and was working on his Master’s Degree, which he completed shortly after he was released. It was a big moment for our family, and I was so proud of him because I knew how hard it is to stay committed to a goal, and harder still when you have a felony on your record. My baby brother was defying the odds and dreaming of new possibilities when his life was abruptly ended by gunfire, making him another in a long line of casualties in an environment where escaping the odds seem as impossible as getting a master’s degree. 24 \fLike many people getting out of prison, Sherrod was trying to figure his life out. Now he was dead, and the details of his murder were infuriating. The suspected killer was someone my brother thought of as a friend. He had broken bread at our family’s dining room table and acted the part of a good friend. I was devastated, heartbroken and compressed in a furious swirl of feelings: anger, sadness, thoughts of revenge, shame and guilt. I had devastated a family, and now my family was devastated. I had taken a life and inflicted the same pain my family was now feeling. I dried my tears and stuffed my feelings down, but they were raging. I called Liz, tears streaming down my face. Without hesitation, she offered to fly out and help me pack my suitcase for the long trip home. I said no, but in her wisdom, she came anyway. Once she got to LA, I asked her to come with me to Detroit, and she did. Her presence and ability to navigate all the logistics allowed me to be fully present for my parents and siblings. The weight of grief isn’t meant to be carried alone, and and despite being in the midst of an emotional storm, I could see clearly that Liz was here to stay. Our angels show up when we need them most. 25 \fOn the plane, I pulled up my laptop and used the time to liberate the words that were choking me, caught somewhere between the pit of my stomach and the back of my throat. I had never imagined I’d have to navigate trying to grieve while knowing I, too, had killed a man. I knew that if I did not write, I would unravel. I dumped the contents of my heart and mind into a letter, the first draft of which was like raw sewage. But I kept refining and finished it in the parking lot of the hotel. I am writing to the person who took Sherrod’s life. Though you don’t know me personally, you know my family. You know the details of our family home, the sound of my parents' laughter, the taste of food cooked and served with the same love, that the rest of our family friends have come to enjoy. So, although you didn’t know me personally our lives are connected in a way that I wish was not possible that extends from my little brother’s life to his death. Thirty years ago, in July 1991, I made a terrible and regrettable decision. I shot and killed a man. He was not just any man, but a father, son, husband, and beloved friend to those who knew him. This past weekend, you also shot and killed a man – my younger brother, 26 \fSherrod. He was a son, uncle, brother, and friend to many. Although I only have fragments of the circumstances that led to my brother's death, the reality is that we both have caused immeasurable pain and grief for the families of the men we took from this world. My brother's life was more than a collection of moments; it was a complex tapestry of what it means to be human, incomplete and imperfect in all the ways a life lived exists. Despite my brother’s struggles and his past, he was on the right path and his life was valuable. I pause here, because I wonder in your reckless disregard for Sherrod’s life, did you hold the belief that life is only valuable when it fits into a neat, tidy box, or when it is free from the struggles and challenges of everyday life? As I reflect on my brother's death, I feel a range of emotions, including anger, and heartbreak. It is a harsh reality that weighs heavily on my soul, and I feel a tremendous amount of guilt knowing that I have caused another family to experience the same pain and loss that my own family is going through. It is a terrible burden to bear, to be both a victim and a perpetrator of gun violence. 27 \fNothing can bring my brother back, just as nothing can bring the man I killed back to life. That is a reality that weighs heavily on my soul as I now imagine what it is going to be like to wander through Detroit, seeing empty faces everywhere I look. Nothing will ever be the same again. Our family will never again hear my brother's laughter or listen to his endless jokes and dreams for the future. Our friends on Ferguson Street where Sherrod and I grew up, will never be able to drive or walk past our home where they were welcomed and look at it the same way. The joy and excitement that once characterized my parents' home have been replaced by grief and profound anger. The pride I once had for Detroit has been shattered in a way I never could have imagined. As I now sit in the parking lot of my hotel, all I can think about is all the other places I would rather be right now, like back home in LA. But here I am, just days away from laying my brother to rest, knowing that my soul will never be the same again. Even amid horrendous loss, my thoughts were about your soul, and it was a contradiction to other base-level thinking. On one hand I was angry and on the other hand I was finding my way to 28 \fcompassion. I thought about how terrible your own trauma must have been to lead you down this path. I was confused, and still, my hope was that one day you would find the healing and the peace I believe humans are capable of. I hoped that you would find the strength to confront your own demons and make amends for the pain you have caused. And most of all, I hoped that you would find a way to contribute something positive and meaningful to the world, as a way of honoring Sherrod’s life and the lives that have been forever changed by your actions. I wondered if you felt the same, if you were wracked with the guilt of killing Sherrod and the grief of knowing your friend is now dead. I wondered if you regretted the callous decision to leave my brother’s body to be discovered by his father and big sister. I wondered if you understood the weight of what you had done, the ripple effect that your actions have had on our families and our neighborhood. I wondered if you were capable of empathy and remorse or if you were consumed by anger and violence. But most of all, I wondered why. Why did you choose to pull the trigger, to end my brother's life and shatter so many others? What 29 \fcould have been going through your mind in that moment, what could have justified taking another human being's life? I don’t know if these questions will ever be answered, or the pain of my brother's loss will lessen over time. But I hope you find a way to understand the gravity of what you have done and the impact it has had on so many people. I hope you find a way to make amends and seek forgiveness before your death, not just for yourself, but for all of those who have been affected by your actions. Sincerely Shaka I ain't no perfect man I'm trying to do, the best that I can With what it is I have I ain't no perfect man I'm trying to do, the best that I can With what it is I have 30 \fWhen I returned to LA after laying Sherrod to rest, I descended into a deep state of grieving, a labyrinth of sadness, anger, and guilt. Questions about my own mortality, the future of my son and all the boys who came from where I came from, swarmed into my consciousness like hornets defending their nest. What could I have done differently? Why does violent death happen so often to those who come from where I come from? Is God Angry with Black men? What if we had grown up in another environment? What if Sherrod had been paroled to LA to live with me and start his life over out here? Like many who find themselves in grief, I was self-flagellating. I beat my ass with question after question, each one whipping down on me, barely giving me time to recover. My thoughts were stuck like cars slogging through LA traffic. It was one of the toughest parts of grieving, one moment you're laughing or enjoying a moment and boom, like a sledgehammer crashing through drywall, a hole is knocked into you. Patching, spackling and smoothing that hole over, took time, presence and action. The first step was accepting grief along with the 31 \fanger and shame that it opened inside of me. “My little brother is dead.”: Just saying it out loud allowed me to start moving my mind and heart forward. Slowly but surely, I allowed myself to mourn Sherrod and to mourn all the new things I wouldn’t get a chance to share with him, and that he would never achieve or experience. I thought about him never getting the chance to be a dad, a husband or to own his own home.. Some years ago, I heard someone on TV say the most important part of our life is the dash between the day we are born and the day we die. March 11th, 1978 – dash – July 9th, 2021. That was my brother’s dash. What did it mean? It meant my brother had lived a life full of laughter, love and loss, and that we were lucky to have him here with us for that time. That’s what I clung to, to get back to living my life. The dash of grief between when Sherrod was born and died had given me a new way of seeing things. Grief came bearing the gift of presence which forced me to zero in on gratitude. Despite the heartbreak of his death, I had a deep sense of gratitude for his existence. Reflecting on his absence, made me more thankful for the time we got to share while he was here in the physical. My gratitude 32 \fwas so strong that it recentered me with an understanding that being thankful is one of the greatest ways to experience the magic of this thing called life. After the funeral repast was over, all the condolence letters read and acknowledged, and my two weeks of bereavement leave over, I told myself to jump back into the swing of life. In reality my journey of grieving my brother was just getting underway. I was now existing in a state of high-functioning grief. I went back to work, took the countless Zoom meetings and the phone calls. On and on it went. Grief goes everywhere and nowhere. It hides between the cracks of moments, sometimes as a robber and sometimes as a gift bearer. Grief doesn't have a pause button; it doesn't wait. Sometimes it leaps at you, other times it crawls upon you, subtly nuzzling up to you, as you find yourself in a ball of tears, or in a burst of anger, or in a knot of depression. At other times it has you smiling and laughing at a memory of your loved one. There's an ugly magic to it, the way that it manifests in these moments. When I became empty from grief, I filled myself up with work projects and home projects. Instead, I should have said fuck it all and 33 \ftaken the time out to really heal myself. Allowing ourselves to grieve fully and honestly is an act of liberation. It’s a master key capable of unlocking all the other prison doors we find ourselves behind. No one gets through life without loss or escapes grief, but you can free yourself from the anger, guilt, and the depression it brings. Beginning to break free from the grip of grief, I couldn’t entirely control the waves of emotion, but I could allow myself to stop and acknowledge those emotions in their entirety. I learned to show myself grace, tenderness, and thoughtfulness. Grace means allowing yourself to lean into your feelings to fully process them. Tenderness means giving yourself permission to grieve and leaning into your support system. Thoughtfulness means extending that grace to others and communicating effectively with those around you. I also learned that grief can manifest in various counterproductive ways: in unfolded laundry, dishes piling up in the sink, lashing out at loved ones, oversleeping, under-sleeping, overeating, drinking in excess, and smoking more. I was grumpy, impatient, less kind, and more focused on goals instead of the people in my life. 34 \fThe heavy parts were the guilt, the anger, and the survivor's remorse. Over and over, I interrogated myself like a suspect on “The First 48.” What could I have done, what could I have said. what step could I have taken to help change the outcomes? Yes, I was healing, but I was having a reckoning simultaneously. There was the grief of losing my brother and the guilt of my own misdeeds. It was knocking me silly. In the past whenever I was hurting, I would turn that hurt into energy to succeed or accomplish some external goal. But in the process, I was imprisoning myself, by directing that creative energy outward, instead of inward. To free myself from this prison of grief, I prayed deeply, meditated daily, created a gratitude mantra which said I am thankful, even for this and wrote out my thoughts about life. With each word written or spoken I found myself climbing out, moment by moment, while thinking about how proud and amazed my Sherrod would be. Nearly three years after Sherrod’s death, I came across this passage while reading Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom. While talking to 35 \fMitch about a dream, Morrie said “That’s what we're all looking for. A certain peace with the idea of dying. If we know, in the end, that we can ultimately have that peace with dying, then we can finally do the really hard thing.\" Which is? \"Make peace with living.” Not all of us get to prepare for or make peace with death. Sherrod certainly didn’t. But as long as we are breathing, we can be present in life, while making peace with grief. With that knowledge I shifted my focus to what I could do with those around me. I could share my love, lessons, resources and be fully present with the people in my life. But it had to start with me. Here’s what I want you to do right now in this moment. I want you to stop and do a reflection meditation. How is grief showing up in your life? What are all the different ways it has shown up? Thinking about my answers to this question and writing them down is what helped me unearth the myths I’d been telling myself. Seeing the myths, was the first step in breaking free of them and in learning to communicate effectively with those who were truly there to help me. 36 \fMyth 1: You have a limited amount of time to get over grief. Myth 2: Grief comes to an end at some point. Myth 3: You will never experience joy, love or success again Myth 4: It won’t get better These myths, like so many falsehoods we tell ourselves, create hidden bars that are hard to see, and even harder to escape. One night, three months after Sherrod was buried, the LA autumn was slogging by in a haze of blazing hot days, and beautifully warm nights. Liz and I were at home winding down after packing for an upcoming trip. Earlier in the day, we’d dropped our dog Indy off with a new trainer, and the house felt quiet without him. Just before settling into the evening, my phone rang. It was the trainer calling to say that our beloved puppy, Indy, had been hit by a car and killed. I couldn’t believe this shit. I rushed to the vet. The vet took me to the back to see my boy. He looked serene, like he was peacefully sleeping under a cover. But he wasn’t sleeping, our big, beautiful boy was now dead. I held back 37 \fmy tears with Herculean effort, as I slumped back to my SUV. I sat for what felt like hours trying to gather myself, though I’m sure it was only minutes. The vision of Indy lying dead in a cold vet hospital collided with the image I had of Sekou being home tucked safely in the warmth of his bed, and the vision of Liz waiting for me to walk in the door. I played back the conversation with the trainer in my head. He said Indy had slipped out of his collar after trying to bite a pedestrian. The knot in my stomach clenched tighter, as I sensed he was lying. I wanted to jump back out of the truck, and confront him. I was in a dark place and spiraling. The darkest, repressed part of me was urging me to seek revenge, not just for Indy, but for Sherrod. As Carl Jung said “Unfortunately there can be no doubt that man is, on the whole, less good than he imagines himself or wants to be. Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is” When Sherrod was murdered the homies on the block wanted blood and retaliation, but I talked them down. It was counterintuitive to my anger and the code of the street I had been raised in, but I was 38 \fexhausted from seeing our community caught in the loop of trauma and violence. My core philosophy “Everyone is redeemable” which I shared publicly was now being challenged internally. I was proud of how I led the homies and our families through it, while repressing my own thoughts of revenge. But here I was again fighting my shadow. Then it hit me, it was too late to protect Sherrod or Indy. They were both gone. The only ones I could now protect were at home, one sleeping and the other waiting for me to return. I had to go home. I sped out of the parking lot, still holding back the river of tears that were threatening to break through the dam. The next morning, I lay in bed aimlessly scrolling through Instagram, when I jumped to the trainer’s page and saw him with his daughter playing with a beautiful German Shepherd. The photo sent me spiraling back into a smoldering rage. I wanted to run his dog over, so he could feel how we felt. The shadow had been reawakened. I knew I would never act on those thoughts, but I needed to feel the raw emotion of my anger, and I needed to confront those 39 \fdestructive ideas. After all, one can't truly know if they have changed unless they are faced with something that challenges their sense of who they are. So here I was confronting my shadow, trying to grieve and trying to love simultaneously. I shared my dark fantasy with Liz, who helped me purge my heart and truly grieve. The death of Indy, coming so soon after Sherrod’s murder unearthed emotions that I thought I’d processed. I had to finally accept that my brother Sherrod wasn't coming back, that Indy wasn't coming back, and that our lives would be forever changed. But beneath the grief, there was anger—a raw, burning rage at the unfairness of it all. And then there was shame, creeping in like an unwelcome guest. Shame for what I didn’t see, for what I couldn’t change, and for the questions that wouldn’t stop haunting me: Should I have done more? Could I have prevented this? Could I have vetted the trainer more thoroughly or read more yelp reviews? The grief, the anger, the shame—they were all tangled together. This realization was pivotal; it showed me that healing isn't just about coping with loss but also about confronting and understanding the complex layers of emotions that accompany it. 40 \fComing out on the other side doesn’t mean that you forget. I could never forget about my brother Sherrod or our beautiful puppy Indy. In fact, the opposite is true; grieving allowed me to be thankful and remember the beautiful and sacred moments even more. In the early stages after Sherrod and Indy’s deaths, I was numb, then angry, then sad. I was angry at my city, at my hood, at the man who shot my brother, at the trainer, and at life. Coming out on the other side gave me a deeper commitment to ending gun violence, loving shamelessly, and preparing myself to love the next puppy that comes into my life. Nearly three years after Sherrod and Indy’s deaths I was tentatively feeling like things were looking up. I left the company where I had been working and ventured back out on my own as an entrepreneur. Liz and I had grown deeply in love, gotten engaged, and were preparing for our wedding. Sekou was thriving in school, getting all A’s, playing football, basketball and soccer, while making new friends. He had been a stellar student at Baldwin Elementary and had teachers who adored him there. In his new middle school, he 41 \fwas playing piano, video games, and just being a kid. He was excelling at everything with an ease that blew my mind. Then one day Sekou was rushed to the ER, where a scary few hours led to a three-day hospitalization and a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes. A new chamber of grief had now been opened in my heart. I was now grieving the loss of Sekou’s seeming invulnerability and the comfort of being his protector. “Am I going to die, dad?”, Sekou asked me as we sat outside in the hospital courtyard. “No son, you aren’t going to die,” I said with all the confidence I could muster, while internally falling apart. I knew I wasn’t the only parent facing this question, as I had seen many teary parents walking the halls of the pediatric unit. This was my baby boy, the wonder kid who showed up in love, curiosity, and with the most charming smile. My intelligent little artist, whom I’d managed to shield from the evils I had seen as a kid. But now his own body was turning on him. After assuring him that he wasn’t going to die, I said, “Son, sometimes the universe gives its warriors battles they didn’t ask for, but when a warrior embraces those unwelcome battles, they become 42 \fa gift to themselves and others. You are a warrior, your name Sekou Akili means scholarly leader, and if there is anyone who can lead through a difficult time, it is you, son. Together we will win this battle, but you must lead us, because this battle was given to you!” “I will lead it dad,” he responded as he leaned on my shoulder. With one hand, I combed my fingers through his hair, while wiping the tears from my eyes with the other. Grief's Unforgiving Nature As the saying goes, hindsight is 20/20. But grief distorts our perception. I’ve spent countless hours asking myself the tough questions: Did I miss signals about Sekou’s health? Could I have found a better trainer for Indy? How could I have prevented Sherrod’s incarceration or murder? This kind of self-interrogation can become a heavy blanket of shame, leading to a life filled with regret, anger, and doubt. There are so many forms of grief in this life—grieving past decisions, lost friendships, ended relationships, loss of youth and jobs we’ve left behind. Each comes with its own set of regrets and 43 \fquestions: Did I quit too soon? Did I give enough? Did I do enough research? Did I give my all? Grieving these losses can be just as profound and lingering as the grief for a lost loved one. The Weight of Anger and Healing Grief often brings anger, an emotion that can feel as relentless as dandelions on a hillside. For me, anger blossomed uncontrollably, and there was no blowing away the pollen or making a wish. I had to sit with it, confront it, and let it be. Like an inexperienced swimmer fighting a riptide, I kept struggling against the current of my own emotions, hoping that somewhere out there, a lifeguard would come to save me from myself. In those dark moments, I would sit up and talk to Liz, who would take my hand and listen as I vented about the unfairness of it all. I wanted to act on my anger, to unleash it, but I knew that wasn’t who I wanted to be anymore. It’s a mindfuck to try and grieve and love simultaneously, especially when our culture doesn’t create space for us to feel fully human. 44 \fFinding Resilience and Purpose Grief has taught me the importance of finding purpose and sticking to it, of not letting anything get in the way. It made me appreciate the moments, experiences, people and pets even more. Over time, I found solace in Mos Def’s song “Umi Says,” which became my morning anthem—a reminder to keep going, to honor my pain, and use it as fuel. Grief comes in layers, each one peeling back to reveal another layer of pain or memory. I miss the arguments my brother and I had, the inside jokes, the barbecues on Ferguson Street, and the days when our house was full of music, laughter, and life. None of my friends died peaceful deaths; they were victims of carnage, flesh, and twisted metal, a not uncommon outcome in our neighborhood. This is a reality I hoped I'd escaped--but pain and loss are part of life. And now I miss Indy and our walks through our peaceful neighborhood, and I miss the spontaneity of grabbing ice cream, or a slice of pizza with Sekou without counting carbs, or him having to jab himself with a needle. 45 \fFinding Light Amidst Darkness Grief is a master teacher, and in its lessons, we find the strength to keep moving forward. Sherrod’s death imprinted a new picture of our family dynamics, one that we are still learning to navigate. Our absent loved ones are the missing pieces that complete our picture, reminding us that no one deserves to be left alone in a vacant house of memories. Grief may never fully release its grip, but it shapes us, molds us, and in its own painful way, propels us to find meaning in the moments we have left. It teaches us that the journey is not about overcoming grief, but about carrying it with us, allowing it to be a part of our story without letting it define us. 46 \fChapter Two Anger \"You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger.\" – Buddha My anger was an uninvited guest, akin to a phantom who infiltrates someone's home and takes up residence without the owner's knowledge. As a child, I never saw myself as angry, quite the opposite. I was the well-behaved, easy-to-get-along, promising young kid who earned scholarships and made the honor roll. I won praise from my friends' parents for being kind and courteous and was the kid my family saw as a beacon of hope for a successful future. My parents dragged me out of bed to read to my grandparents and showed off my artwork, and my uncle John dragged me out of bed to dance like Michael Jackson for the family. I was a cool and handsome kid with lofty dreams, and I envisioned myself becoming 47 \fan artist or doctor—occupations I believed were both noble and creatively altruistic. In that childhood dream I could serve people or create in a way that helped people feel better. All that changed when my trust was betrayed in the worst way imaginable. I went from the kid who shoveled the neighbor’s snow and picked fruit from their trees for them, to the kid stealing from the store and getting into dustups at school. That bright young scholarly boy with so much promise was now donning a mask of toughness and acting out in ways that were outside the margins of how I was raised. Though I didn’t have the right language for it back then, I was a wounded child who grew into a violent young man, causing harm to many, including myself. As I got older, I increasingly lost control of my emotions, getting angrier and more daring in my juvenile exploits.. I thought my anger was a source of power. But in truth, my anger had trapped me, locking me in an internal cage that ultimately led to physical imprisonment and solitary confinement. Several years into my sentence, I experienced a particularly dark time. In solitary and unable to retaliate against the man in the 48 \fnext cell, I was left with nothing but my rage-filled thoughts and nowhere for them to go. I picked up a pen and began to write with brutal honesty, pouring out everything I’d been holding inside. What became painfully clear as the words filled the page was that my anger wasn’t just controlling me—it was suffocating what little good I had left inside me. I discovered the author Louis L'Amour while I was in solitary confinement. His words came back to me: \"Anger is a killing thing: it kills the man who angers, for each rage leaves him less than he had been before—it takes something from him.\" Anger had stripped me of everything, including my freedom. It stripped me of self-control, dignity and the ability to peacefully co-exist with others. But in that solitary cell, reading through my own words in a moment of stillness, I resolved to take back everything the anger had stolen: my sense of emotional safety, self-love, and purpose. All were mine to reclaim. The Rage Cage The jangling keys, metal footlockers scraping open, and the occasional profanity-laced outburst formed a discordant symphony— 49 \fthe soundtrack of solitary confinement at Oaks Correctional Facility in western Michigan. It was February, one of the coldest of months in Michigan, with relentless snowfalls that blanketed the prison yard for days on end. I waited, as usual, for the changing of the guard—the morning crew relieving the night shift—before reluctantly pulling myself from my bunk. I used the dull steel toilet in the corner of my cell, before brushing my teeth in the rusty sink that was attached to it. As I returned to my bunk, I glanced out the tiny window to see workers dressed in dingy kitchen whites, pushing food carts through a foot of snow, backbreaking work that made me ponder the irony of full employment in prison (we started at seventeen cents an hour) and rampant joblessness in the neighborhoods most of us came from. After inhaling my breakfast of watery green eggs, damp burnt toast, and stony grits, I waited for the officer's morning question—did I want to go outside for my hour of recreation? The officers hated taking us outside and I equally despised those cages, eight in a row, no bigger than dog kennels. But even in the arctic cold, going out to the yard was the only option for getting out of my cell for an hour five 50 \fdays a week. The tier had been relatively quiet in the past couple of days, and not many of the men had been going out, due to the cold. But I yearned for fresh air, a reprieve from the stench and madness of the cell block. When the officer came by, I nodded my head affirming my intention to brave the frigid outdoors, after all it was only for an hour. My prison wardrobe basically consisted of a thin faded blue and orange state issued jacket, cheap plastic shoes and gloves better suited for gardening than the cold. Handcuffed and shackled I trudged down the tier. The cuffs bit into my ankles with each step, one of the many painful costs of accessing fresh air. I stepped into the stabbing cold. I began to regret leaving the semi-warmth of the cell block, but my lungs and skin craved the fresh air, so I pushed on. From one of the cages nearby, a man we called Two Toned due to his uneven and bumpy skin, made some wise crack. I acknowledged him but kept my response terse. He had a reputation for talking big within the safety of his cell but showed less bravado on the general population yard. We called men like Two Toned cell gangsters: guys 51 \fwho talked shit when tucked safely behind the cells in solitary confinement but clammed up when confronted on the yard. I had no desire to associate with him, or any of the other shit talkers in solitary. I had learned early on from the old heads:—“If a man isn’t willing to serve a life sentence or die for you, don’t consider him a true friend.” It was our distorted way of marking friendship. The prison yard was filled with fleeting allegiances of convenience, and I sought to avoid the drama. But Two Toned was heading out to the yard, and as officers went about the business of removing our cuffs, he began to talk shit. The officers merely smirked. Over the next hour, I ran around in a small tight circle between sets of pushups. With my hour drawing to an end, I was damp and freezing, but the officers weren’t in a rush to bring us back in. Instead, every few minutes one of the officers would stick his head out of the cellblock door, only to close it with a laugh. They were deliberately stretching out our time in the bitter cold, a crude reminder of the power they held. This was only a glimpse of the brutality inherent within the system, where one person's actions could lead to 52 \fconsequences for everyone. I hated paying the price for other people’s fuck ups, and Two Tone had fucked up, leaving the rest of us to pay the tab. Hours later, when the officers were hustling me back to my cell, I was battling both the bone-chilling cold and a rising storm of rage. My helplessness in the situation triggered my anger, and I was trying hard not to lose my cool. It was a battle that I felt myself losing. With my feet and hand’s numb from the cold, I looked the officers dead in the eye and swore to them that when, not if, I got out of there, I was going to fuck them up. One of them returned my glare and uttered, \"You ain't never getting out of here, motherfucker.\" His acerbic words were piercing, and I felt my frozen fist fighting to clench as the handcuffs tightened around my wrist. Damn, what if I never get out of here? I had men nearby who had been in solitary for ten and twenty years. Back in my bunk, I heard a rapid succession of thumps on my cell wall. It was John, a guy in the cell next door, who had just come from the protective custody unit. “Can I get a couple of cigs on credit, until next store run? I promise I will pay everything I owe.” John had 53 \fbeen owing me money for cigarettes for two weeks prior and I couldn’t believe he had the audacity to ask me for more on credit. John ignited my already short fuse, and I snapped, \"Man, fuck you, you ain't paid what you owe yet.\" A few minutes later, he decided to retaliate by blowing out the power in my cell using a staple from a magazine. It was one of the ways the men in solitary waged war on each other. This power outage meant I couldn’t play jazz on the little radio I used to block out the noise and chaos of the environment. The assaults of the day kept coming: first from the officers, then the frigid temperatures, and now this power outage. My anger had reached the tipping point. “Bitch I’m going to kill you when I get a chance, I don’t give a fuck If I have to come over to the protection unit to get your hoe ass,” I threatened beneath the door. For the next hour or so, I plotted my revenge. My mind raced like the proverbial hamster on a wheel with an endless loop of fantasies of revenge. There was no way for me to get to John or the officers in a way that would satisfy my anger without punishing myself. So, instead I was forced to face my anger head-on. Anger had consumed my latter teenage years and my young adulthood, 54 \fleading to fights, shootouts, robberies and everything in between. It was a life I was weary of, a life of deep suffering. Unlike the Fyodor Dostoevsky quote from The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, I didn’t want to suffer so that I may love, I wanted to love and be free of anger so that I no longer suffered. After pacing my cell floor and calming myself down, I sat back on my bunk, lowered my head, and began to meditate and then to pray. I meditated to clear the fogginess of the moment and prayed to free myself, both mentally and physically. But I was also in the deep throes of a pity-and-woe-is-me party when a powerful thought struck me: I needed to express my angry thoughts, to write about the darkness that had engulfed me. It was terrifying. A voice told me to let it all out, no matter how painful or shameful. I took the flimsy state-issued plastic pen and began to detail what I would do to my neighbor John whenever I got the chance. The more I detailed my fantasies, the more I desired to stop writing, but I forged ahead, hoping to sate the anger I was feeling. I was also being forced to acknowledge the truth of who I had become. In year two of solitary, at twenty-eight years old, serving my ninth year in prison, I 55 \ffaced the haunting questions: How much worse would I become if I didn't change? How did I go from a dream of being a doctor to serving out my most promising years in prison? Why was I quick to anger and violence when things didn’t go my way? Journaling about harming John led to a profound process that was both gut-wrenching, and enlightening. I had been through so much trauma, that my authentic fun-loving, happy self-had been completely buried. The more I wrote, the details of my traumatic journey finally allowed me to see that I was solely responsible for what happened the rest of my life. Only I could unlock the cage door that held me in bondage. It didn’t matter if the officer was right about me never getting out, if John continued to be a pusillanimous asshole or if I was forced to freeze in exchange for the chance to breathe some fresh air-the rest of my life was all on me. I had a choice in how I felt and more importantly how I acted. So, I wrote. I journaled about the pain, the rage, the betrayals, and my own misdeeds. Journaling isn’t a passive set-and-forget-it deal; it’s not just jotting some shit down. Active journaling forces you to get off your ass and grab your life by the reigns. You have to 56 \fobsess over the details and dig down to where the truth lives. Despite the physical confinement, writing gave me the satisfaction of moving forward. Sitting with my truth forced me toward action. I wrote as a man desperate to understand himself, hoping to find a path toward transformation. These pages were both a clash of the titans and an escape from the abyss, a release from my past, my rage, and my confinement. As Thich Nnat Hanh so aptly put it “Letting go gives us freedom and freedom is the only condition for happiness.” It was a journey that began with acknowledging my shame, disappointments, and failures—hoping it would lead me to the most joyful and liberating experiences of my life. It also forced me to confront all the fucked-up things that had happened to me and to reassign responsibility to those who had caused me harm. Reassigning responsibility was one of the most powerful breakthroughs I discovered through journaling. Yes, I was ultimately responsible for my healing, but I was not responsible for the things that broke me in the first place. When Broken Trust Turns Anger to Rage 57 \fGrowing up on Camden Street was like growing up on a block of superheroes. The men and women on our block mostly had jobs that were celebrated and honored at our school career day. My father was in the Air Force reserves, and a friend’s dad who lived two doors over was in the Marines. Our dads drew the awe of the kids on the block with their neatly pressed uniforms, fit bodies and patches that signaled their rank. There was a woman neighbor who was a police officer, and another who was a nurse. However, there were two men on the block who stood out to us more than the others. One was Walter King, a man who held a black belt in karate and competed in martial arts and won a lot, I mean a whole lot. His living room bore witness to his winning, with trophies that were bigger than me. The other was a man named CM who lived across the street from us, who also claimed to be a black belt. He didn’t have any trophies to prove it, but he did a masterful job of convincing us that he was the baddest black martial artist in Detroit, if not in the world. He even told us that he had trained with famed Black Karate champ turned movie star Jim Kelly. 58 \fHis bragging about his karate prowess often left me and my friends arguing about who would win if he and Walter King ever got into a fight. Our arguments got intense as we pointed out their strengths and weaknesses. While Walter King was bigger and more muscular, CM was trim, fit, and told us that he’d trained with the best in the world. For us it all came down to power versus speed. I mean it was the late 70s and 80s when Karate and Kung Fu were our life. But as intense as our arguments were, they brought us more joy than anger. During that time Martial Arts was everything in our neighborhood. We traded Bruce Lee posters and discussed the Kung Fu films we watched on Saturdays. There was even a Karate school around the corner from our house. I remember the older boys wearing Karate shoes for fashion and us kids using broom sticks, chain links, and rusty nails to make Nun chucks. So those beloved Martial Art heroes towered over the other hard-working men and women on our block. It was a Saturday evening, when my friends and I all decided to go to the movie double header that CM held about once a month at his house. He charged fifty cents or so for each kid, provided popcorn 59 \fand sold penny candy. As we stood outside CM’s house along with his nieces and nephews eating candy while awaiting entry, we wondered aloud if he was going to show us Enter the Dragon or scare the life out of us with Michael Myers’ character in Halloween. Either way, we were prepared to be scared or fired up to practice Karate moves on each other. We watched the movies, ate candy and popcorn until late in the evening. When it was time for us to go, CM asked if any of us wanted to spend the night and watch more movies with his nephew and nieces since they were going to be staying over. They were excited to have us for a slumber party, and we were excited by the promise of more snacks. I ran across the street and pleaded with my mother to let me stay, and when she agreed I ran back across the street excitedly. We spent the next couple of hours watching movies and playing in the basement. When it was time for us all to go to bed, CM started assigning sleeping areas to each of us. Two kids could take his son’s bed, a couple could sleep on the couch, and me and his son could sleep in his bedroom on the floor. Back in the day it wasn’t uncommon to make what we called pallets on the floor of a family 60 \fmember or friends house when we slept over, so I thought nothing of it. We went into his bedroom and lay on top of the blankets we had piled up on the floor and drifted off to sleep. I don’t know how long I was in a slumber when I felt a hand on my shoulder nudging me awake. It was CM and he was whispering. The early part of what he whispered is a bit fuzzy, but what I remember most is him asking me if I wanted to play with him. I was confused about why he wanted to play late at night and said as much. He then asked if I wanted to get in his bed naked and play with him. My heart began pounding in my chest. My parents had warned us of bad men and women who wanted to do weird stuff with kids, though they never quite said what weird stuff was. But what CM was asking sounded like weird stuff. I started to get scared and felt like I was somehow going to get in trouble with my parents, but I still wanted to go home. I would rather face them than to be in that room with that weird man asking me weird questions. I told CM I wanted to go home. Gripping my shoulders tightly, he said I couldn’t go home tonight but could go and lay on the couch with the other kids. He also gritted his teeth and told me not to say a word to my parents. 61 \fI rushed out of his room and into the living room and stuffed myself as deep into a corner of the couch as I could. In that moment I hated CM and everything I had once loved about him. I hated the smell of his house, the cheap popcorn, and the grandiose stories of being a martial artist. I swore to myself that I was going to learn Karate and kick his ass when I was older and strong enough. I knew I was too small to fight him and was lucky that I was precocious enough to know that something wasn’t right. I remember laying on the couch afraid to go to sleep while wondering about the other kids in the neighborhood. I remembered that some kids stopped coming around or attending the Saturday movies, even some of his own nieces and nephews. But no one ever said why. It all started to make sense. When I got home the next morning, I wanted to tell my father and mother, but I was too ashamed and afraid. Like many parents of that era, my parents hadn’t created the space for us to feel confident coming to them. I said nothing. The fear lingered, but I could also feel it turning into anger and resolve. I had to do something. 62 \fBreaking in to Break Out A year or so later--I was eleven years old. I was hanging out after dark in front of my house with some older boys when they started talking about how to make some money. We were always foraging through alleys for bottles for the 10-cent refund, and we would also cut the neighbors grass or shovel snow to make a few bucks. But we were getting older, and our desires were growing. We were always hungry and trying to hustle up enough money to grab Better Made Chips, Faygo Soda -- which we called pop -- and the cheap packs of cookies we bought two for a dollar. One of the guys who, appropriately, we called Crook, suggested we break into someone’s house. I was terrified by the idea. A few houses had been broken into by the older boys in our neighborhood, and the way our parents talked about it, it sounded horrifying and disrespectful. The rash of burglaries had grown so bad that many of our longtime neighbors had moved away. I will never forget the sadness of seeing a senior couple named Mary and John moving out of their home. There would be no 63 \fmore homemade raisin bread baked by Mary or having our hair tussled by John as he told us stories about the Detroit Tigers legend Ty Cobb. I didn’t want to make anyone in our neighborhood feel like that, except for one person: the perverted motherfucker across the street. The thought of us violating CM’s house of horror felt right. I wanted to hurt him bad and let him know that someone in our neighborhood didn’t want him there. When I told the fellas that I had a house we should hit, right across the street, they thought I was bullshitting. I told them about the two VCRs and TVs along with CM’s musical instruments and they got excited. “Let’s go,” one of the boys said before darting across the street; we all followed suit until we were standing on the side of the house jittery as if we had overdosed on Jolly Ranchers and Now & Laters. We could tell no one was home. I followed the others around the house as we tried to find a window that wasn’t locked. The only one we could open led into the basement. I went in solo, with a plan to go open the door upstairs to let the others in. I had last been inside the house the night of the sleepover. Even though I knew the space 64 \fwell, it all felt strange. Everything in the basement seemed outsized and almost animated with life. I rushed up the stairs to the side door and quickly discovered it needed a key to unlock it from the inside. I ran through the kitchen toward the living room to try the front door, just in time to see a flash of blue and red lights painting the inside of the house. My little heart was beating like a kick drum. I could hear an officer talking to one of the boys outside and threatening to kick his ass for trying to get into the house. At first, it sounded like the police didn’t realize I was inside. I tiptoed into CM’s bedroom and climbed under the bed. Even from my hiding spot, I could see out to the driveway and to the flashlights of what seemed like a legion of police surrounding the house. Soon enough, they knew I was inside and talked to me through the window and told me to open the side door. I told them there was no key in either door. They told me to reach up through the window so they could pull me out. They grabbed my hand and the back of my pants and dragged me through. I had scrapes and bits of glass in my hands but otherwise was no worse for wear. 65 \fWhen my eyes adjusted to the dark, I could see a small gathering of our neighbors standing in front watching. They didn’t know the boys I was with, but everyone on the block knew me. I could hear a few neighbors asking is that Pumpkin’, my childhood nickname, and saying things like boy you know better, and I can’t believe this. Then I looked up and saw my mother standing there shaking her head. My mother and I had a complex relationship, but despite our struggles, I never wanted to break her heart or embarrass her. I hoped the officer would release me into her custody, but instead, he informed her I had to go to the precinct with the rest of the boys until the homeowner decided whether to press charges. At the 9th precinct, I sat in a glass cell for hours before the officers finally returned with news: the homeowner, CM, wasn’t pressing charges. They loaded me back into the car and drove me the short distance home. When we arrived at Crook’s house, we were greeted by his mother in a nightgown, screaming at him. As soon as the officers let him out of the car, she began to slap him upside his head as she told him how stupid he was. I began to shake like a soaking wet puppy as 66 \fI thought about what was going to happen to me when I got home. I anticipated the fiery lash of the belt that I knew was going to tear into my flesh. As we got closer to my house, though, the fear of the asswhooping shifted to anger. CM was the motherfucker who’d been saved from having his house robbed, and that pissed me off. But as we drove to my punishment, the people I was getting angry at were my parents. They were the adults. They shouldn’t have trusted CM to begin with. If they’d protected me, we wouldn’t be in this situation. What’s Inside Must Come Out Decades later, I was sitting in a cell, reading an old journal entry about what I had wanted to do to CM. I felt a deep brooding shame. But, with a calm mind, I was now able to offer the little boy inside me a long-needed emotional hug. I had been intoxicated by anger for most of my life, and now, for the first time, I was coming to terms with the way that anger had allowed me to run away from the truths I needed instead to face head-on. For many years, to my detriment I used anger to navigate the power dynamics in prison. The angrier I became the more 67 \fpowerful and less vulnerable I felt. I lay on my bunk, confronting a fear I had long-ago buried: the fear of myself and the fear for myself. I was confronting deep shame, fear and secrets I had held on to for years. I was confronting the broken little boy who had become a broken, angry and dangerous man. It was time to face the darkness within and find a way back to the light I once knew as a boy. I had never felt more helpless or hopeless than when I was forced to deal with my own thoughts. Reliving the traumas of my past while grappling with my rage toward CM had left me drained. I needed a break from reading my journal, so I sought solace in reading passages from a few of the books on my desk, including Plato’s Republic, before drifting off into a restless dream-filled sleep. In one of the dreams, I found myself in an ancient setting--the Lyceum perhaps--surrounded by men preparing for a heated debate. The environment shifted, and I suddenly stood naked in a small, dark dwelling, face-to-face with my opponent—my angry self. For the first time in my life, it was angry me-vs-authentic me, my best thoughts of myself-vs-my worst thoughts of myself. It was war. This dream battle 68 \fof my past self raging against the new self I was trying to become provided me with two important lessons about life. As long as you have breath in your lungs, you can go back and affirm that innocent kid. And if you are courageous enough to face the worst of who you were, you can become the best version of who you are. Over the next few days in my cell, pushing through one jagged sentence after another across my notepad, I delved into my past trauma, anger, and violence. As I dug down through those layers in search of my authentic self, what struck me was this: the specifics of our anger don’t matter as much as what we choose to do with it. The sources of that anger are often long-gone, and we have the power to choose how we respond to their memory I had cracked the code and realized I was slowly but surely escaping, liberating myself with wisdom and a testimony that cried out from deep inside of me, in the form of the ink that bled out unto the crumpled notepad I held tightly in my hands. For the first time in my prison sentence, I realized my life calling, my raison d’être, was to be free of all of the things that no longer served me or that stood in the way of true happiness. 69 \fI realized I had been imprisoned by anger years before the police ever put handcuffs on me. And while I couldn’t control when I would be paroled, I now understood I held the keys to my own freedom. It was this awakening that started me on the path to healing. My family and community culture never encouraged me to be vulnerable with others, and this silence led to a world of hurt for my victim, my family, and myself. For most of my walk of freedom, I had avoided talking to my parents about the anger that drove me to seek revenge, become violent and to serve time in prison. It wasn’t until the week of my fiftieth birthday that I began to change that. In separate but equally deep conversations with each of my parents, shit got real. My anger towards CM was appropriate, but often my rage had me firing at the wrong target. I obtained true freedom by recognizing this, and by making decisions that honored my painful past, without leaving myself or others in deeper pain. I’d been convicted of violent crimes and served hard time. These facts were and are forever 70 \fbranded to my name, but they don’t define all of who I am or have been. My anger didn’t fade with a journal entry or even later with the opening of a cell door. I was finding clarity about the real source of the anger, but it doesn’t magically disappear for anyone who has faced trauma -- be that sexual assault, child abuse, emotional violence, disrespect or from those daily moments where we feel the sting of prejudice. Power and control reside in developing tools that help us recognize our triggers. The tools aren’t complicated – it’s things like journaling, talking to that trusted friend, or taking that drive while listening to a song that lifts your mood. The goal ultimately is to transform the energy of that anger into fuel for self-love, for creation, for action, for reasserting the right thing to do. Or, in my case, do like Rakim when he said, “I start to think, and then I sink into the paper, like I was ink”. Turning fifty, I found myself reaching for the familiar and welcoming power of words, but this time instead of writing them down 71 \fwith a makeshift pen, I made those calls to my parents and told them the truth about where it had all begun. They were devastated, but, most importantly, they were present to hear it all. Drilling Down If ever there was someone capable of helping you plot and execute your own escape from anger, it would be someone like me. Throughout my youth and young adult years my anger manifested in many ways: defensiveness, confrontations, an inability to resolve conflicts without violence, shutting down, taking things personally and resorting to extremes in challenging situations. For a long time, I wore my anger as a protective mask and energizing force, but in fact it was robbing me of joy, happiness and fulfillment. I thought the mask would keep harmful people distant, but instead it ensured that no one could touch my vulnerabilities or establish a deep connection with me. Things began to change as I journaled and eventually asked myself deep and probing questions. Through journaling, I realized that by acknowledging the painful events of my youth, I could shift the blame back to those who truly 72 \fharmed me. It took a while, but eventually I developed true empathy and compassion for the younger me, understanding that I was merely a child, seeking protection, safety and care. Through journaling, reading and meditation I was finally able to place the blame where it truly belonged. Today I invite you to reflect on these questions: How has anger stood in the way of true happiness? How has it influenced career or business opportunities, friendships and relationships, or how you see yourself? These reflections can serve as a guide to understanding your own life: How can you reassign blame appropriately? And how can you recognize when anger is locking you into a self-imposed prison? Keys to releasing anger 1 - Write Down Your Anger When you find yourself in the grip of anger, take a moment to put your feelings on paper or on your phone or laptop. Write down what specifically is causing you to feel this way. Later, when the intensity 73 \fhas subsided, revisit what you wrote. What I discovered for myself that it was both old and new shit, but mostly old shit that had me locked into anger. 2 - Identify the Primary Emotion Be patient with yourself and dig deeper. Anger often masks other emotions such as shame, sadness, fear, or frustration. Try to identify what's beneath the surface of anger. What I learned was that it was never the person cutting me off in traffic, or the rude service person, it was always something deeper in my past. 3 - Create a Counter-Mantra Craft a mantra that counters the negative aspects of anger. \"This anger doesn't serve my higher good, it doesn't optimize my potential, and it doesn't add value to the life I am worthy of.\" Repeating this mantra can help shift your perspective. 4 - Meditate to Release Anger 74 \fConquering anger involves acknowledging it, understanding its underlying causes, and actively working to counter it with positive affirmations and calming practices like meditation. These steps allow you to transform your relationship with anger and find healthier ways to manage and release it. Meditation can help you calm your mind, gain perspective, and release the intense emotions associated with anger. Practice meditation until you feel the angry energy dissipating. If you are having trouble getting started, I highly recommend you check out The Miracle of Mindfulness by Thich Nhat Hanh: “Mindfulness is the miracle by which we master and restore ourselves.” Liberating yourself from anger doesn’t mean you are in denial about its source. But often you need to ferret out anger from its hiding spots, blind spots, and sore spots. Hiding spots are when anger comes out. When you are short with a colleague, snippy with your intimate partner, mean spirited toward your kids or lash out at a neighbor who leaves their trashcan in front of your driveway, it often means you’re using the anger to hide from something. 75 \fBlind spots are when you aren’t even aware of what is happening inside you when the smallest thing sets you off. You may not even be truly aware of the source of this rage. Sore spots are those areas of your life where your anger is easily triggered, when an old pain flares. Getting underneath the emotion in these moments is when you have the greatest opportunity to break free. 76 \fChapter Three Shame “I can be changed by what happens to me, but I refuse to be reduced by it.”-Maya Angelou Standing in my parents' living room on Ferguson Street, I watched what felt like an endless stream of people flowing in and out of the house. My parents sat at the dining room table, where they had sat for decades when company came by. It was the place where we watched the game or listened to my dad pontificate about life. It was where we played music and spades, laughed and joked, and where people now sat with tears in their eyes. Although I was surrounded by family and friends, I felt something inside me breaking and something deeper breaking open. This wasn’t just grief or anger—it was deeper, heavier. It was a shame, a weight I had carried for years but never named. As we laid Sherrod to rest, I realized I 77 \fwasn’t just mourning his death—I was mourning a part of myself that I had buried in a prison cell many years before. On the flight back to LA, the weight of shame sat on my chest like extra baggage I couldn’t check at the gate. Shame I carried from childhood, through prison, and now as a big brother who couldn’t save his little brother. If I was going to be free, I had to unpack that shame and its roots. On the surface, there was anger and grief, but also something else, something more. Guilt had been my go-to for years, my default emotion. Even though I had been forgiven and had forgiven myself, there were moments when guilt would rise from my gut and spill over into my life. So, over the next few months as I sat at home and at work, labeling what I was feeling guilt felt logical, practical and easy. I asked myself, “Is this my karma? Is this what I get for my past? Is this our family’s chickens coming home to roost?” Questioning myself while watching my family grieve brought me to the edge, but what really broke me was the sadness in my stepmother’s eyes. That’s when I realized it wasn’t just guilt I was 78 \ffeeling—it was shame. I didn’t feel worthy of being in the room, shedding tears with my loved ones or consoling anyone. It was suffocating. And it wasn’t just about Sherrod. It was about everything. Sitting there and looking into her eyes, into my dad’s, into Sherrod’s dad’s eyes, I felt indicted. I had to get up and go outside to breathe, just breathe. When I stepped out the front door, a few of the younger members of my family and some of our friends swarmed around me with hugs and consoling words, but I couldn’t fully receive them. I was too deep into feeling like I didn’t deserve their love and concern. That’s the thing about Shame, it gets so deep inside you, you can’t appreciate the fullness of what’s happening outside of you. It wasn’t the first time I had felt shame, but now I felt I couldn’t escape. That sense that my life would always be marred by my past was the essence of being locked into the shame cage. That shame took me back to CM’s bedroom, to the first time I learned to hide behind anger and guilt. As a young boy unable to speak up, to name the danger I was in, feeling shame for being preyed on by someone I trusted, I felt like something was wrong with 79 \fme. Before I got out of prison, I thought I could save everyone in my family and neighborhood from the things I had gone through. I thought the letters I sent home sharing my experience and the cautionary phone calls would get the job done until I could be there in person. I thought I had wisdom from my experience on the streets, credibility from surviving prison, and the respect that comes with getting out and staying out. But that’s not how life works. I realized I didn’t have the power to change the outcome for Sherrod any more than I had been able to for my cousin who in an act of desperation had committed suicide, for my niece who got caught up with a boyfriend and ended up in prison, or for my four nephews who all landed in prison as well. Grief and shame trigger the “what ifs,” and provide the magical notion that we can somehow control someone else’s life choices and outcomes. Those What ifs are like the bars of the cell: we tell ourselves bullshit stories, we villainize ourselves, and we try to award ourselves power that we cannot possess. The truth? I couldn’t save my brother, nor anyone else, and as a kid I damn sure couldn’t have known that CM was a pedophile. I 80 \fcould caution, warn and advise, but I was not the puppet master controlling the actors. However, I did have the power to liberate myself from the damning all-encompassing feeling of shame. As Friedrich Nietzsche questioned and answered \"What is the seal of liberation? No longer being ashamed in front of oneself.” When I was thirty, still in solitary confinement and journaling as a way to chart a path forward, I wrote this: \"I’m really struggling with an internal conflict, and it feels like I’m losing the battle. I’m letting negativity take root in my heart, and this prison is seeping into my pores. I miss my old self. I want to laugh again. My thoughts have become so negative I can’t believe they’re mine. I don’t know how I got here—how I can’t imagine anything positive happening for me without something negative creeping in. I want to believe there’s something good in my future, but the more I try to believe, the more the negative shows up. I can’t keep living with these thoughts.” When I left prison I truly thought I had moved on from the anger and the guilt, . but when Sherrod died, something inside me snapped. 81 \fI had moved past guilt, but the anger and shame still clung to me like a shadow. Every time I shared my story or truth—in interviews, with friends, or lovers—I felt like I was being dragged back into that prison cell, defined by my worst moment. My past had been weaponized against me in concrete ways more times than I could count. In interviews, I was antagonized. In relationships I was reminded that I had murdered a man. And every time I filled out an application and checked the box that asked if I had a felony, I was brought back to 1991. Each time, I felt smaller, more broken. It was easy to tell the world that we shouldn’t be defined by our worst moments, but when the world kept doing just that, it was hard not to believe it. While I hadn’t physically recidivated, I found myself returning to an emotional prison I’d thought was in my past. I knew I had to find a new way out and as with any great escape plan, I needed support. Finding support in books and the stories of others had helped me break through when I was in a prison cell. This time, as I searched to better understand shame, Brené Brown’s name kept coming up. Like millions of people, I watched her TED talk and 82 \flistened to her interviews. We were practically besties—or at least that’s what I liked to joke. Sure, her TED talk had 20 million more views than mine, but we’d both written books, so in my head, that made us twins—except, you know, for the obvious differences. But the deeper I got into her work on shame, the more I started to resent it. It was pushing me in ways that felt exhausting. I was tired: tired of telling my story repeatedly. Tired of searching for a way out of the deep shit through stories that had torn me to shreds. Each time I thought I’d made progress; something would pull me back. A news headline —boom, a trigger. A conversation with a stranger—trigger. Filling out a job application— trigger. Even something like travel—trigger. And there it was again, over and over. But I knew I had to trust Brené and her brilliant work. I mean if Oprah and millions of people across the world trusted her, who was I not to? Brené outlined four key pillars of shame resilience: recognizing shame and understanding its triggers, practicing critical awareness, reaching out for support, and speaking shame. Sounds simple enough, right? But shame had been running wild in my life for so long 83 \fthat I couldn’t even see it for what it was. It didn’t show up in neat little boxes like she described. I put Daring Greatly down, made up narratives of why it didn’t apply to me, and generally just called bullshit on her, more times than I care to remember. But I kept coming back. Then one day her definition of shame hit me like a Gervonta Davis punch: shame is negative self-evaluation, believing there’s something inherently wrong with you. Damn. Negative selfevaluation. Believing something was wrong with me. Brené had helped me crack the code. That’s what I had been doing all along, without even realizing it. Every time I looked at my family, every time I got into a heated argument with someone I loved, I was reliving that same shame. I had convinced myself that something was wrong with me, and I had to show people that I was okay, I wasn’t a threat and I was a good human being. I was overcompensating, trying to prove I wasn’t some monster. But at the same time, I couldn’t fully absolve myself for the things I’d done. It was madness. A sickness. A prison of its own. I let family members and friends use my past as a weapon. I let colleagues exploit my story, my insights, my brilliance for their own 84 \fgain. All in the name of trying to be accepted, to feel “normal.” I stayed in relationships long after their expiration date because I thought it was my responsibility to make others feel whole—even when I wasn’t whole myself. That money you lend to a family member that’s never paid back. That insight you share with a coworker that gets used in a big meeting while your name is never mentioned. That was me—guilt, shame, and the desperate need to be seen as normal let me justify other peoples’ actions that caused me harm. Personally, and professionally, I was living in a mental prison as brutal as any cell I’d ever been in. But here’s the thing that hit the hardest: this feeling wasn’t new. As a kid, I was often the butt of jokes from the older homies after my family broke apart. I roamed the neighborhood, a runaway youth, long before I was seduced by the drug trade. I felt shame from things large and small: like that time, I ripped the seat of my pants climbing a neighbor’s garage and had to walk down the street with kids laughing at me. My friends thought it was hilarious, but I felt embarrassed as hell, trying to cover my torn pants with my tiny hands. I was ashamed 85 \fof my parents’ divorce and the times when we had to rely on government issued food, because coming from a broken home and poverty meant you were less than. One memory surfaced in my mind when I started doing the deep work around my shame. We were standing outside Denby High School on the east side of Detroit, an assortment of teenagers clad in Fila and Adidas track suits. Hip-hop was still finding its identity, and we were in the middle of one of our first ciphers. I’ll never forget hearing someone shout from the back, “He’s biting, he’s biting!” I spun around, expecting to see someone chomping on another kid’s arm or leg. But instead, a finger pointed at one of the boys who had everyone gathered around. “You stole those rhymes from Chaucer. Those aren’t yours.” The boy tried to deny it at first, but before he could get the words out, other kids chimed in. I think I remember that moment so clearly for two reasons. First, the series of emotions that flashed across the kid’s face— from shock to embarrassment to what I now recognize as deep shame. I felt bad for him. And second, it baffled me that someone 86 \fwould want to claim someone else’s story so badly they’d steal it and present it as their own. Yet we’ve all done it - posing as someone we want to be instead of who we are. I've imagined I was a basketball player every time I tossed a piece of paper into a wastebasket. I also imagined who I’d be without the conviction, without the guilt, without the shame. I was fighting against the narratives forced on me, but I was also trapped by the ones I had built in my own mind. My shame had me believing narratives about me that simply weren’t true. I had taken chunks out of my own identity, swallowing stories and lies that weren’t mine, ideas that caused me harm. I knew then that if I didn’t break free from this shame, I’d never live up to my dreams of being a good father, a good husband, a good human being. I had to reclaim my story. I wasn’t just a boy with a gun. I wasn't the worst thing I had ever done. I was a man who had made terrible mistakes, but I had also worked to apologize, to atone. I was a man of my word, a man who had built a family, a career, and a life worth living. I also wasn’t a bad kid who tried to burglarized CM’s house, I was a kid who was angry at an adult who tried to sexually assault him. 87 \fIn 1961, Carl Rogers gave us one of the keys to breaking free in his book On Becoming a Person: A Therapist’s View of Psychotherapy. Rogers doesn’t just explore the mind—he digs deep into the heart of what it means to be personally free, self-accepting, and living with authenticity. His message? You’ve got to fully accept yourself—flaws, scars, mistakes, all of it—before real growth can happen. Freeing myself from shame didn’t come from resisting who I am holistically, but by embracing it. As Rogers said, “The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.” Those words coursed through me like the waters of the Nile, as if they had always been meant for me. And even years later, they still ring true. Today, I realize this war I was fighting wasn’t just about freeing myself from guilt, anger, and shame. It was a battle for my soul. It was about whether I could make peace with my past and still have the courage to build a future. Could I sit with the darkest parts of my story, and still find light on the other side? That’s Rogers’ message: transformation through radical self-acceptance. It’s the hardest fight any of us will ever face. 88 \fThis wasn’t about shedding my identity as a convicted murderer or embracing a different one as a writer. It was about rejecting the emotional responses to trauma that were keeping me locked in a version of myself I no longer wanted to be. We’re all imprisoned in some way. We all have our hidden prisons. We cling to what’s familiar, even when it’s harmful, because we’re afraid of the unknown. But true freedom means questioning those old beliefs, rejecting the outdated narratives, and creating a new identity. Digging Deeper What are the things that make you feel unworthy? What are those things that make you slink back into old ideas of the self that no longer exist? Maybe it’s the sting of abuse, or the weight of being embarrassed again and again. Some carry the shame of not standing up for themselves. But here’s the truth: standing up for yourself starts with believing you’re worth the fight. It’s knowing, deep down, that you’re lovable, worthy of respect, deserving of dignity. When I failed at something, it used to eat me alive. Missing deadlines when I worked at the Michigan Citizen, fumbling words on the stage, unintentionally hurting a loved one’s feelings—it made me 89 \ffeel hopeless, like I couldn’t get anything right. That’s what shame does. It blinds you and binds you. It keeps you from seeing all the times you did get it right, all the moments when you showed up for yourself and others. Shame erases your wins, both big and small. But those victories are real. You’ve got to fight for and hold onto them. Every time I go visit a prison and stand in front of men and women still locked inside those walls, I’m reminded of how far I’ve come. I’m reminded that the more freedom I claim for myself, the more impact my work will have in helping them find their own way out. But I’m also reminded of how easy it is to slip back literally and figuratively. The mental prison is always waiting, but now, I know I have the keys to break free. One of the things I also learned from journaling is the power of going back and reassigning the proper emotions to your past experiences. I remember once when I was a kid, one of the older homies telling me, \"Your daddy is gonna whoop your ass,\" as he looked down at the wreckage of vinyl records scattered all over the sidewalk and street. I had taken stacks of my dad’s prized records 90 \foutside, and we launched them across the neighborhood like frisbees, laughing, completely oblivious to their real value. When my dad found out, he didn’t yell at first—he just looked at me with something in his eyes that hit different. Yeah, he was mad, but there was something else—something deeper. I couldn’t put words to it then, but I could feel it, right in my chest. I think that’s one of the moments when I felt shame. The look in my dad’s eyes told me that those records had value well beyond their price. For years that look haunted me. Behind my dad’s anger, there was sadness. I had broken something that meant more to him than I could understand. He wasn’t just mad about some records—he was hurt. My dad loved music. Lived for it. Collecting those records was his pride. He grounded me, kept me inside while my friends played outside. But honestly, the real punishment was the shame I felt— shame in hurting him in a way I hadn’t even realized I could and depriving him of something I couldn’t replace. But here’s what made the difference: my dad didn’t let that shame fester. He sat me down and talked it out—explained why it 91 \fmattered, why breaking other people’s things wasn’t just about the stuff, but about respecting what they valued. He knew I didn’t fully understand what those records meant to him, but he took the time to explain, and he gave me space to try to understand and grow instead of letting that shame define me. But I still managed to carry that moment with me into my incarceration. Shame wasn’t new to me, but prison worked it into deep grooves. From the first time I was told to bend and spread my ass cheeks during a strip search, to being denied food, there was a litany of daily shame-inducing assaults. There was the time an officer wouldn’t let me head to the showers because I didn’t own a pair of the specific cheap tan shower shoes we were supposed to have. I tried to get by with my regular shoes, but the officer coldly cut me off saying the only alternative was to go barefoot in that grimy, diseaseridden shower where thirty men had just gone through. I let that shame curl up into something darker: anger. I was mad at the officer for how she treated me, but mostly, I was mad at myself. I had been a drug dealer on the street, I had a family with jobs and friends who 92 \fhustled, but I didn’t have two dollars to purchase shower shoes. That tiny moment of powerlessness caused me to shrink inward. Here’s the thing about shame: it doesn’t always come from the worst things we’ve done, or the worst things done to you. Sometimes, it shows up in quiet moments when you’re faced with your own humanity, when a small indignity chips away at your pride and uncovers the rawness of your past, something painful, something vulnerable. There was a moment like this at work I’ll never forget. I was one of the only men I knew convicted of a serious crime who had risen to the rank of C suite executive. We were just months away from launching the rebrand. I was at the helm of Corporate Communications at a company changing its name from TripActions to Navan. I was responsible for taking an existing video project and turn it into something the sales team could use to sell our product. The video had to shift from the usual corporate style to something more people-centered. I was hyped. This was my moment to do what I knew I did well: I was a master storyteller and had a knack for 93 \fconnecting with people on an emotional level. This should have been a layup. I dove in with the production team we’d hired, covering the budget, deliverables—everything that came with a project of this size. There was pressure, sure, but I was ready. I put together a storyboard, sent out my instructions, and waited for the team to deliver an Emmy-worthy video. Then the first draft came back, and it wasn’t what I had envisioned. The video was dark, which should have been the first red flag. Missing that warm and vibrant, people-first vibe that reflected our new brand identity, it wasn’t what I was aiming for. I raised my concerns, while trying to encourage the team: “Can you lighten this up in post and give it some swagger?” They assured me they could. And I trusted them. As a creative myself, I knew what it meant to be trusted with a vision and project of this magnitude. I wasn’t just thinking of the bottom line, I was also thinking of the people on the team. But here’s where I messed up. Instead of leaning into my business side—the part that knew I should have given more detailed 94 \fdirection and been more clear with my expectations—I stayed in my creative lane. When the second draft came back and it was still dark, I didn’t push back or scrap that version altogether. I trusted them again. And when the final version was delivered, it was a disaster. It felt like a poorly executed high school project—nowhere near what we needed for the rebrand. When the CEO confronted me about it, my ego was bruised, and I felt the ugly shadow of shame. He didn’t tear me down; he simply told me to find another vendor and get the job done. So, I did. I reached out to friends in the creative space and together we produced a beautiful, elegant video that hit all the right notes. But the damage had been done. I had blown the budget. I had failed on my first big project, and I carried the weight of that failure deep inside me for the next couple of weeks. It was hard for me to lean into the excitement and all the festivities of the rebrand even though I was leading all the communications around it. After the debacle with the video, the CEO and I sat down for our next one-on-one. He walked me through a process he had introduced 95 \fme to called Shimun—an unflinching, methodical approach to dissecting failure. It was supposed to be purely analytical, free of emotion, focused only on learning and course correction. But as we moved through the questions, I couldn’t ignore the sinking weight of shame settling in. 1. What went wrong? – I forced myself to lay out the missteps, but each one felt like a blow, a reminder of what I should have done differently. 2. Why did it go wrong? – The gaps in execution, the overlooked details—I saw them all, and it was hard not to take it personally. The process demanded detachment, but my mind clung to the failure like it was a reflection of my own inadequacy. 3. What can we do differently next time? – This was meant to be the productive part, the moment to pivot toward solutions. But even as we mapped out adjustments, I was still wrestling with the discomfort of having fallen short. Shimun wasn’t about blame, yet I felt its weight. It was meant to be emotionless, yet I found myself wading through emotions I hadn’t expected—shame, frustration, the haunting feeling that I should have 96 \fdone better. And maybe that was part of the process too—not just analyzing failure, but learning how to sit with it, own it, and move forward anyway. But at that moment, I felt ashamed. It wasn’t just about messing up the video—it brought up all these other moments where I felt like I wasn’t good enough, like I hadn’t done enough. And that’s the thing about shame. It’s not about the specific mistake you make—it’s about all the unresolved pain you carry from your past. Shame doesn’t just live in the present moment; it drags the past into your present, making you feel like every failure is proof that you’re not built for success, or worthy of love and joy. I could’ve just accepted the feedback, acknowledged that I had messed up, and moved on. But instead, I started beating myself up. Work no longer felt enjoyable. I felt like I was constantly being tested, like every moment was another opportunity to fail. But the truth is, the only test happening was in my head. That internal voice kept telling me, “You’re not built for this grind. You’re not good enough to be in corporate America. You can’t handle feedback because it brings up all your old shit.” 97 \fThen I caught myself: I realized I had to do more internal work. I had to get down to the truth of why these old wounds kept haunting me. On my flight home from our office in Palo Alto, I wrote a note to myself that said: You may not always get it right, you may not succeed at everything you put your energy into, and you may stumble along on your journey, but if you dare to examine the whole truth of who you are, you will walk away from each moment with a lesson, instead of the bruise of shame, that you have fought so hard to heal. You are an extraordinary storyteller, creator and leader. In fact, you are a bad motherfucker. Afterall not everyone can pull themselves up from the dregs of society to the C Suite. Digging Deeper My invitation for you is to write down five major moments when you allowed shame to hide your authentic self. When you finish your list, go back and read each line and apologize to yourself for the moments you allowed a shameful narrative to take root and for the times you denied yourself the freedom to be a human being. Place this document in an envelope and seal it. Place the envelope in a 98 \fsafe place and wait one year from the day you finish it, to open and read it. While we are on our healing journey it’s important for us to go back and remind ourselves of how far we have come. 99 \fChapter Four Vulnerability \"Vulnerability is our most accurate measure of courage.\" - Brené Brown I tapped \"Home\" on my phone—the contact tied to our family’s same number since 1986. “Hey blood,” my dad answered, using a greeting common amongst the Black men who fought for the country during the Vietnam war. “Hey Pops,” I responded. Vulnerability is something I’ve always had to grapple with, whether it was the kind of vulnerability that came with hustling in the streets of Detroit or simply growing up in prison as a youth. But there’s another kind of vulnerability—the kind that comes from feeling and embracing emotions, even when they’re uncomfortable. Some of the most important steps in my own development have come from breaking through emotional barriers built up between me and my parents, something I started to do in 100 \fdeeply personal and vulnerable conversations I had with each of them as we all recovered from Sherrod’s death. My mom and dad came from a generation that kept everything close to the chest, rarely opening up to their children. I, too, had held in so much over the years, but to move forward I knew we finally had to share more. During one call, I told my Pops that I was working on understanding my childhood. He loves a good conversation and one of his favorite subjects is family. He loves to tell us stories about aunts, uncles and cousins from Mississippi, most of whom I don’t know or whom I only vaguely remember. Growing up we didn’t spend as much time with my Pop’s extended family side as I did with my mother’s side, but he always made sure I knew their names and faces the best he could. As generous a storyteller as he’d been in the past, I was now asking for more. “Pops, what was your dream for me when you knew I was going to be born?” I wanted to know who they were as young parents in 1972. I was curious about their world—what their lives looked like, what 101 \fdreams they had for themselves and for me, and how the events of the times shaped their hopes for my future. My dad was twenty-five, my mom twenty-three. I was my mother’s fourth child and my father’s first. I imagined what it must have been like for them, raising kids and navigating life as a young, married couple in Detroit during such a turbulent era. The year I was born, Richard Nixon was President, and the Vietnam War was still raging. The Watergate scandal was dominating political discussions and eroding public trust in government. Two months after my birth, the Munich Olympics were overshadowed by tragedy. It was a time of political upheaval, racial tension, and social change. How did my parents make sense of the world, and how did they envision my future in it? Amidst the turmoil, there was hope, too. Music and culture were flourishing. Al Green’s Let’s Stay Together, Don McLean’s American Pie were top ten albums that year and Roberta Flack’s “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face” topped the singles chart. The Godfather, one of the greatest movies about family, redefined cinema. Imagining my parents and their lives back then I flashed back to a photo of my 102 \fdad in his Air Force uniform donning an afro, and a picture of my mother in a pretty dress with her pregnant belly. I was eager to hear how, if any, these moments, these cultural shifts, played a part in the dreams they had for me. Who were James and Arlene White in 1972? Like so many of their generation, they were trying to settle down and establish a life for themselves after the turbulent '60s. The Civil Rights Movement had pushed the country forward somewhat, but many of the leaders had been killed along the way. The more militant Black Power movement had been crushed, and racial inequality was digging its heels in deeper. Over the years, my parents had each told me, in their own way, that they were striving for their slice of the American Dream. The house, the dogs, the jobs and racial healing. But I often found myself wondering—where did I fit into that dream? I asked my father about his own upbringing. He told me how his father was the primary cook in their family. He talked about the incredible soul food my grandfather whipped up for his family. I pictured my grandfather’s pecan colored skin as he stood in the kitchen. I imagined the aroma of collard greens, fried chicken and 103 \fmacaroni and cheese. My dad told me stories of playing baseball with the other kids in the neighborhood, about getting in trouble hanging with my uncle John who my dad described as a rabble rouser, about his choice to go down the straight and narrow, because he didn’t like getting whoopings or being punished. My Pops told me he knew from the moment I was born that I was meant for something special in the world. “Son even though your life has had some ups and downs, I knew you were going to help people. I didn’t know when or how, I just always knew it. I never let go of that dream for you, and probably saw it before you did. Remember all of those letters you used to send me from prison, well if I never said this, I want you to know that those letters saved your old man more than once.” The warmth of that conversation finally liberated the little boy inside me who had been carrying a burden for far too long. I finally felt ready for what I knew would be the toughest conversation I’d ever had with my dad. It was time to share the weight of the secret I’d carried with me for so long, a weight that almost killed me. 104 \fI dreaded it and it took me a while to get there. For a few nights leading up to the conversation I had put myself in his shoes and played the scenario out in my head as I thought he’d receive it. As a father myself, I understood how difficult it would be for him to hear that he hadn’t been able to protect me from CM. I didn’t want him to think I was blaming him. My goal was to approach the conversation in a way that would bring us closer. I didn’t want my father’s heart to break, but I needed him to understand why I had broken into that man’s house all those years before. That act of rebellion wasn’t just revenge—it was a cry for help. It was a symptom of something deeper. For years, I had beaten myself up for being a “bad” kid, but as I’d worked through the layers, I’d realized I wasn’t bad. I was a kid who had encountered bad adults. And as that realization took root, it opened pathways for me to grow into a full understanding of personal agency. For years I had blamed myself that something was wrong with me. It took years for me to realize that something was wrong with CM. 105 \fThis is the reality for so many who have been traumatized. We internalize it, blaming ourselves instead of the adults or people who harmed us. “Pops, CM tried to molest me, and that was the reason I broke into his house. I wanted to hurt him the way he tried to hurt me.” I said. There was a moment of silence that hung between us like a sheet on a clothing line. My dad listened quietly as I shared what happened on that night long ago at CM’s. When he finally spoke his voice cracked as he apologized for not digging deeper into why I had done what I had. “Son I am so sorry that happened to you.” He said with a hitch in his voice. He told me that he knew back then that there had to be something more to the story, but he’d never known I was fighting back the only way I knew how. We talked some more and when we finally got off the phone I was spent. I lay down on the couch and drifted off to sleep. While our conversation had been heavy, I came away feeling lighter. Vulnerability didn’t just help me heal—it allowed me to connect with my dad in ways I never thought possible. 106 \f. Later, I called my mother. We’d never had the best relationship, but we had started putting the effort and energy into healing. I was determined to forge a deeper connection, and I decided the way to do it was by interviewing her about my entry into the world. I told her that she didn’t have to share anything she didn’t want to or anything that made her uncomfortable. More than anything I wanted her to know that I was there to understand and learn and not to judge. To my shock and excitement my mother told me I could ask her anything, because she was an open book. My mother’s willingness to be present and share her dreams for me, along with her own dreams and stories was beautiful and affirming. Knowing how difficult it had to be for her to be vulnerable, I felt blessed My mother has a beautiful midwestern drawl, laughs easily and has an innocence about her that emerges every now and then. During the call, she shared things I had never known about her childhood. She told me about the abuse she endured as a young girl, the pain of being neglected and abandoned. She opened up about the assaults on her body, the great deal of pressure she felt she was 107 \funder from the time she was a teenager. Her story hit me hard because I realized that I had carried similar feelings when I was out in the streets, feeling isolated and unloved. I started to see more of the little girl who had just wanted to be loved and protected in the same way I had yearned for safety and acceptance as a kid. I was reminded of something Oprah Winfrey said during a conversation with Dr. Bruce Perry while talking about her own mother. “She did the best that she knew.” Like Oprah’s mother, my mother did the best she knew. Once I told her what happened to me, she said, “I’m sorry Pumpkin, I wish that had never happened,” using my nickname. We sat in silence as we both gathered ourselves. She then told me stories about me being a funny baby and smart little boy. She told me that there were times she was afraid for me and my siblings, because she knew we were growing up in a world that could be cruel and where Black boys ended up dead, or in prison. I thought about both of my parents confronting their own sense of being, the uncertainty of the times and trying to raise children. 108 \fMy father, too, knew the struggles of working in a world where overt racism was a daily reality, and the pressure of providing for his family weighed on him constantly. He joined the Air Force in 1964 at just seventeen. When I asked my dad about that era and what he thought, he shared a perspective we don’t often hear. \"Yes, son, there were some racists, but they were the minority—and they've always been the minority. For the most part, the people I worked alongside were good people who just wanted to serve their country.\" When I asked my mother if she had ever feared for my dad’s safety, she told me there wasn’t a night in those early years when she didn’t breathe a sigh of relief the moment he walked through the door. But as time went on, things started to change. These are the burdens that so many parents carry silently. It was heavy hearing their stories, but they also resonated with my own. Locking away our pain and fears only imprisons us and threatens to destroy us from the inside out. Vulnerability was the antidote. As we opened up, something powerful happened. It wasn’t just healing—it 109 \fwas a release. By sharing our own struggles, we each gave the other permission to share their traumas, triumphs, failures and dreams. When I asked my dad what he thought about the times he grew up in, he said, “Son, it was tough. After my dad moved out, I had to figure out what it meant to be a man. The lessons I needed to know about being a father weren’t there, so I had to figure it all out on my own.” Up until the conversation I’d never even known my grandfather had moved out. Hearing my father talk about his own life made me realize just how many men feel they can’t afford to show weakness or open up and the resentment and pain that creates. I also seen this play out with CEOs, business leaders and coaches who hide behind the façade of toughness. When we allow ourselves to open up, to be vulnerable, we can start to take control of our narrative. We can stop letting shame and fear define us, and we empower those around us to do the same. Hearing my mother’s story of being violated and assaulted brought home why so many women in my life say they don’t feel safe in a world full of men. It also reminded me of something many women 110 \fhad shared on social media. When asked if they would prefer to be stranded in the woods with a bear or a man who was a stranger. Overwhelmingly, women chose the bear. In those conversations with my parents, we covered so much that had gone unsaid for so long—their broken promises, their dreams, their joys, and their heartbreaks. It was painful to hear my father’s sorrow over my incarceration and to know how many sleepless nights my mother spent worrying about me. Though they had shared some of their heartbreak while I was in prison, it was hitting me differently as a middle-aged man, listening to my aging parents. I once facilitated a group discussion around a book called Houses of Healing. I had started the group class after discovering a box of the books in the back of the library where I worked alongside my friend Calvin. After reading the book I asked the librarian if I could run the class. In a matter of weeks, we went from a small group to standing room only. I watched grown men crack open for the first 111 \ftime, shedding tears they had stored up for years and sometime decades. That class empowered me to think about the liberating force that was created by laying bare the things we held inside. But it also showed me that vulnerability wasn’t just about stilling yourself for potential assaults or shedding tears with your fellow man, it was so much more. The power of vulnerability was encoded in daring to be greater than your circumstances by taking your destiny in your own hands. To make it through the trauma and out of prison I had to be vulnerable enough to believe in myself long before anyone else did. Who would have thought I’d achieve the things I have—the mental clarity, the spiritual grit, or the enduring vision? Or that I would receive the proverbial cherries on top: the awards, the accolades, the money, the life I’m living now? None of it came easy, and all of it required an emotional muscle I didn’t know I had, until I decided to claim a new way of seeing life. Opening oneself up is different from simply identifying emotional triggers. It’s about stepping into your truth, no matter how raw or uncertain it feels. Vulnerability forces you to use your 112 \fimagination to create a new way of seeing life. It’s the foundation for healing because, as I’ve learned, you can’t heal what you don’t reveal. It's getting real and raw with yourself. It's more than being honest, it's accepting unchangeable facts, and saying I will no longer allow these things to define or confine me. I’ve also seen first-hand the power of vulnerability in a business context. For years, I worked at Navan under CEO Ariel Cohen. Navan is in the business of helping companies manage their travel bookings and expenses, so when the world stopped traveling, during Covid that was a serious challenge. Ariel responded by bringing the whole leadership team together for a series of offsites where we spent time getting real about the state of our company. We read books together and had one-on-ones with him. This deepened our trust in the company and bolstered our confidence that we would come out on the other side better than before. Indeed, we did: Navan went from a pre-Covid valuation of four billion dollars to a post-Covid valuation of 113 \fover nine billion. The kind of vulnerability that our CEO modeled made all of us stronger. Great leaders aren’t the ones who always have the answers— they’re the ones who get real. The best leaders are those who remain open and transparent, even when things aren’t going perfectly. They are the ones who engage with their employees at a human level, and who look for help from those with different experiences and perspectives. Think of the CEOs who had to lay off employees during the pandemic. The great ones held all-hands meetings, got direct, and provided context. The not-so-great ones hit send on impersonal emails and let HR handle the rest. Great leaders show up in tough moments, admit when they’re struggling, and connect emotionally with their teams. Vulnerability isn’t a weakness—it’s the key to becoming the best version of yourself. It allows you to show up fully in every part of your life. It lets you stop performing and start living. In the corporate world, vulnerability builds trust. It creates an environment where people feel safe to take risks, to be creative, and to grow. When 114 \fleaders are vulnerable, they create a culture where everyone can be real, where failure is a learning opportunity, not a source of shame. At Navan, I once invited the Executive Leadership team to the Ole Skool Cafe, a restaurant in San Francisco staffed entirely by individuals who had been incarcerated. I was nervous about bringing colleagues into that space. I was worried about being judged, but I knew it was vital to connect our company to the work we said we cared about. To my relief, my colleagues showed up with open minds, and we had an incredible experience that deepened our shared commitment. We enjoyed succulent beef short ribs, fried chicken and creamy mac and cheese over drinks and laughs. They connected with the young workers. My goal was to show my team why it was important that we give people second chances, and why it’s important to find talent in unconventional ways. After that outing, our company reimagined how we processed background searches that came back negative. Instead of tossing those resumes out, we probed further and interviewed people with felonies the same way we interviewed other candidates, and that led us to considering hiring people we never would have before. 115 \fIn my journey, I’ve experienced the transformative power of vulnerability as an employee and as a leader, as a son and as a parent. When kids feel safe, when they know they can come to you without judgment, it changes everything. It protects them inside and out because they know they have a safe space to say, “Hey, this doesn’t feel right.” I’ve created that space for my son. He knows he can come to me with anything. If I say something too harsh, he can call me out. He’ll say, “Dad, that didn’t feel good.” That’s something I couldn’t have imagined growing up, and it wouldn’t have been possible if I hadn’t first broken free from my own shame. Learning to embrace vulnerability with my parents made it possibIe to be the father, the man, and the husband I am today. Vulnerability has taught me it’s okay to stumble—whether as a leader, a parent, or a spouse. None of these roles require having all the answers but they do require authenticity, especially when things go wrong. Embracing that lesson transformed my relationships with 116 \fcolleagues and teams, fostering trust, which is the foundation of every successful partnership. In my personal life, it was breaking down on a call to my friend Fame while on my way to the hospital where Sekou lay in bed. Vulnerability, in that moment, wasn’t weakness—it was a bridge to connection and support when I needed it. In prison it was talking to my friend Calvin everyday about my dreams as writer. In that moment, I wasn’t just talking about wild dreams, I was having my thoughts affirmed by a friend. The most profound lesson vulnerability taught me, both in my personal and professional life, is this: when you get real, when you drop the armor, you create space for others to do the same. That’s where healing happens. That’s where real connection and growth begin. Whether in the boardroom or the living room, vulnerability is what makes us human. It’s the key to leading, loving, and living with purpose. At first, vulnerability feels like a risk, like stepping onto unstable ground with no guarantee that it will hold. But what I’ve found is that the moment we stop holding our stories hostage, we stop being held 117 \fhostage by them. That’s the paradox of vulnerability: what we fear will break us is often what sets us free. Maya Angelou knew this truth intimately. When she was first asked to write I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, she hesitated. She feared what it would mean to lay her story bare—the trauma, the struggles, the moments of deepest pain. Would people judge her? Would speaking it aloud make it more real? But she did it anyway. She wrote. She told her truth. And in doing so, she not only freed herself, she gave voice to millions who had felt trapped by their own untold stories. She later wrote: \"There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\" That’s the lesson. Vulnerability isn’t just about exposure—it’s about release. It’s about stepping into the light of our own truth and realizing that no matter how heavy our stories feel, they become lighter the moment we share them. The most important conversations I’ve ever had weren’t with my parents or anyone else. They were with me. And those are often the hardest conversations to face. Vulnerability became the force that allowed me to confront my deepest fears, especially the self-accusing 118 \fspirit within me—the part that had been cloaked in shame and humiliation for years. Opening up to vulnerability wasn’t just an emotional tool—it was a pathway to freedom. As you move forward, I challenge you: What stories are you still carrying that need to be freed? What truths are you holding back that could be the key to your liberation? Because vulnerability is not just about admitting our fears—it’s about walking through them and coming out the other side, stronger, freer, and more fully ourselves. Keys to embracing professional vulnerability 1. Practice Honest Reflection Take time to reflect on the areas in your work and life where you feel guarded or disconnected. Ask yourself: What am I avoiding sharing or confronting? What fears or insecurities are holding me back from being my authentic self? 119 \fWrite down your thoughts in a journal to gain clarity and start breaking down the internal walls you’ve built. Acknowledge your emotions without judgment and allow yourself the grace to grow. 2. Start Small and Share Intentionally Vulnerability doesn’t mean oversharing; it’s about opening up in a way that builds trust and connection. Start with someone you trust—a trusted colleague, a coach, or a mentor—and share something you’ve been holding back, like a fear, failure, or challenge. This practice strengthens your ability to connect emotionally and shows others it’s okay to do the same. 3. Set Healthy Boundaries While vulnerability is powerful, it must be paired with clear boundaries. Identify what is appropriate to share in different spaces, like work, business relationships, or public settings. At work, be honest about challenges but avoid unnecessary oversharing. In business relationships, communicate your needs and expectations clearly. Boundaries ensure that vulnerability creates connection, not confusion or harm. 120 \fBy reflecting honestly, sharing intentionally, and setting boundaries, you can begin to unlock the transformative power of vulnerability in your work life and business relationships. Keys to embracing personal vulnerability 1. Reflect and Connect Journal Your Thoughts: Take a few minutes each day to write down what you’re feeling—your fears, hopes, and things you’re grateful for. This simple act helps you connect with your emotions and gain clarity. Go for a Walk with Someone You Love: Take a stroll with a family member, your partner, or your child. Use the time to share what’s on your mind and invite them to do the same. Walks naturally encourage open, flowing conversations. 2. Nurture Relationships Through Simple Acts 121 \fMake a Weekly Phone Call: Reach out to someone you love—a parent, sibling, friend, or mentor. Ask how they’re doing, share something meaningful, and let the conversation bring you closer. Write a Letter: Sit down and write a heartfelt letter to someone you care about. Share your appreciation, memories, or hopes for your relationship. It’s a deeply personal gesture that builds trust and connection. 3. Explore New Avenues of Vulnerability Go on a Journey of Discovery: Take an adventure—a road trip, a hike, or even a visit to a new café. Use it as an opportunity to reflect on your own story and share pieces of it with someone you trust. Try Something Outside Your Comfort Zone: Join a group activity, take a class, or try a new hobby. These experiences often require a bit of vulnerability but can lead to unexpected connections and personal growth. By integrating these small yet meaningful actions into your life, you’ll begin to nurture vulnerability in both yourself and your 122 \frelationships, creating deeper bonds and discovering new layers of authenticity. Chapter Five Forgiveness \"Forgiveness is giving up the hope that the past could have been any different.\" – Oprah Winfrey I remember reading The Lion and the Mouse from Aesop’s Fables when I was a kid. It was a simple story, but it stuck with me—how a mighty lion, capable of crushing a tiny mouse, chose mercy instead. And how, in an unexpected twist, the mouse later 123 \freturned that mercy, gnawing through the ropes that trapped the lion, setting him free. What stuck with me even as a child was the idea that giving something to someone else can lead to the same thing being given to you. Mercy leads to mercy. In the first chapters of this book, I’ve written about the ways the negative twin forces of anger and shame reverberated inside me, locking me in a dark loop of action and reaction that imprisoned me body and soul. My redemption came by focusing on the powers at the other end of the spectrum, equally powerful but reverberating towards light and healing. Embracing them led to my own freedom. One of the most powerful of these forces is a close cousin to mercy, and that’s forgiveness. One of my favorite lines about forgiveness comes from another writer I read as a kid: Mark Twain. In Pudd’nhead Wilson he writes, \"Forgiveness is the fragrance that the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it.\" Like that crushed violet, forgiveness is not about seeking justice—it is about giving and receiving grace. It is what we offer not because the other person has earned it, but because we refuse to let 124 \fpain define us. It is the moment when the lion, instead of roaring in rage, lets the mouse go. It is the moment when the one who has been hurt chooses to unshackle their heart rather than live imprisoned by resentment. I had to undo some knots to find my own way to forgiving, not just others, but myself. As a kid, I'd constructed an emotional penitentiary around myself, forged from the raw materials of my traumatic past and the suffocating silence that draped over my family like a weighted blanket. In my inner world, in my hood, and in my family, apologies were as rare as an Amur leopard. We had this skill of roller-skating over our conflicts without ever slowing down long enough to observe the damage caused. We'd step from heated arguments over past grievances to false reconciliations, never putting any genuine emotional sweat into it. That lack of resolution had me deeply entrenched in layers of resentment, hurt and anger, so fortified against the idea of truly pardoning myself or others that it once drove me to attempt suicide when I was sixteen, sitting in my basement bedroom with a loaded 125 \fshotgun and bottle of pills. I had carried the weight of CM attempting to molest me, carried the weight of being abused as a child and of feeling abandoned by my mother. That weight is what led me to that isolating moment in the basement. It wasn’t just one singular bad thing I’d experienced, it was the cumulative weight of all the things bearing down on me at once. On my own path, I have received forgiveness from a woman who had every reason to despise me: the woman who had told me she raised the man whose life I took. Yet instead of choosing hatred, she chose to release the weight of her pain—and in doing so, she freed both of us. I had to find my own way to forgiveness—not just for others, but for myself. I had to forgive the man who shot me, and I had to forgive my own mother for the wounds that ran deeper than the ones that bullets left behind. Forgiveness is an affirmation of deep, radical, unconditional and uncompromised self-love. It’s now clear to me that being forgiven is a gift that we all have an opportunity to pay forward, and most 126 \fimportantly, forgiveness is one of the most liberating gifts we can give ourselves, by receiving it when offered. Receiving forgiveness from others and forgiving yourself are one thing. It’s another to go there with someone else. That was still something I needed to learn. In 2022, I got a phone call from Rick, a friend I’d made while inside. He had received a letter that was meant for me, written by a man serving a life sentence in prison. It wasn’t uncommon for brothers on the inside to write and send letters to be passed on, so it wasn’t a shocker that someone would send him a letter meant for me. “It’s from a brother named Terrence,” Rick said. The name didn’t ring a bell. “What’s it about?” I asked. I heard Rick take a deep breath. “You remember a woman named Angie from Brightmo?” “Sure, I know her,” I said, not really getting where this was going. 127 \f“The letter is from her daughter’s father. He’s the guy who shot you.” Suddenly, I wasn’t talking on the phone to Rick anymore— instead, I was standing on the corner of Blackstone Street, on the west side of Detroit. I was seventeen years old. There is the sound of gunfire, the smell of flesh burning—my flesh—and the feeling of blood gushing from my leg and foot. The gun had been fired by Terrence. And thirty-two years later, he wrote to me. “Send me the letter,” I said, and then I hung up. I sat back, staring at the phone on my desk. The universe was at it again. I had long ago pushed aside thoughts of ever putting a name to the shooter. That’s when it hit me. My journey toward forgiveness was never meant to be a quick and seamless jaunt. It was a journey that would take me back to move me forward. For thirty years Terrence was nameless and faceless—now the man who had tried to kill me now had a name and a face. He shot me on March 8, 1990 — and Rick called me on that same day thirty years later. Was the universe trolling me? At first, I 128 \fdidn’t even want to open the letter—this man had tried to kill me, and so much of what came after can be traced right back to that day. But here I was with Terrence’s letter in my trembling hand. For a fleeting moment, held deep within my body, I thought that with a few JPay messages and collect calls I could have this motherfucker murdered for less than a thousand bucks. A prison yard is full of men who for a fee stood ready to do whatever someone asked —that’s how some guys took care of themselves or helped their loved ones on the outside. The proverbial gun was in my hand, and it wouldn’t take much for me to pull the trigger—he was completely vulnerable to my vengeance if I so wished; my influence still ran deep behind the walls. I realized with a start that such fantasies could still exert a momentary chokehold on me. Briefly the hot-headed seventeen-yearold still had wanted revenge, to get my lick back. It was the way of the hood and prison yards I had grown up in, a code that says, we can’t be at peace until we get even. 129 \fBut just as quickly I knew there was another option: I could choose to forgive this man and create a space of healing for both of us. Too often my own trauma had led to me traumatizing others; but this brutal cycle could only be broken by someone taking action that didn’t involve payback, that didn’t believe in the possibility of “getting even.” Life isn’t even, isn’t fair, isn’t something that can be zeroed out like a bill. Fortunately, by the time I got Terrence’s letter, forgiveness and healing had become a much more important part of my inner math— I’d long since stopped thinking in terms of “even.” Forgiveness was now an integral part of my healing and how I lived life. Almost twenty years earlier, I had received the astounding gift of forgiveness for the life I had taken. That singular act helped me embark on my transformative journey, one that compelled me to untangle the terrible choice I had made that night. This path of healing helped me recover my empathy and compassion—not just for that broken teenager I once was, but also for others seeking my forgiveness. Others including Terrence. 130 \fI knew that forgiving him wouldn't be easy. Like most people on their freedom journey, I was still figuring this shit out. It was a winding road, full of potholes, roadblocks and obstructions around every corner, and here, now, was the mother of all potholes. But before I could let my trauma speak, I was tearing open the envelope. Terrence’s letter was powerful and profound. Through his words, this man came alive to me as a human being whose experience of trauma mirrored my own. I looked him up on the Michigan Department of Corrections website, and studied his face, before closing the computer and returning to his letter. It was an extraordinary thing to read—this man who had caused so much suﬀering in my life was now taking ownership of it and apologizing in what I truly felt was in a heartfelt way. I’d carried anger and resentment towards him for so long, and reading his letter allowed me to begin to let go. I started to write back to him immediately, but I tore that letter up. And to this day, I’ve yet to send him a reply. Some wounds are so deep as to be beyond words. 131 \fWhat he did didn’t just aﬀect me—but my entire family deeply. And to be able to express that fully isn’t in my writer’s toolbox, not yet. But while I have not yet found the words to send back to him, his own words released me to forgive him. Instead of writing to him, I did end up finally writing to someone else I’d been avoiding. As I’ve shared, my mother and I have always had a complicated relationship, made even more so by my time in prison and subsequent release. It took seventeen years for my mother to visit me in prison, and when I got out, it was challenging for us to connect. For years, I resented her. I blamed her for my broken childhood and for the feelings of abandonment I experienced while in prison. But eventually I realized that I had to free myself from the idea that my mother or anyone else would magically morph into who I wanted them to be. Often our desire to forgive is motivated by the idea that 132 \fthe person we are forgiving will transform into our idea of who we think they should be, rather than accepting them for who they are. I wanted to really get to know my mother for who she is and forgive her without any expectations that she would become someone else. As part of that process, I invited her along on a trip with Liz, Liz’s mother, Sekou and me to White Oaks, an animal conservatory in Florida. It felt like the perfect setting to get to know my mother in a way that was far removed from our lived experience. For starters, the place was expansive and full of beautiful animals, many who were on the verge of extinction or endangered. This would be a safe place for us to get to know each other and learn each other’s stories. Through studying conflict resolution, I know that setting matters just as much as the individuals when it comes to fostering understanding and creating space for healing In prison, resolving a conflict becomes significantly harder when everyone is watching, where it is all but impossible to pull someone aside for a private conversation. For this trip with my mother I wanted a safe environment that didn’t trigger one or both of us. 133 \fI have always loved animals. As a kid I was mesmerized by tapirs and the flightless kiwi bird. My fourth-grade teacher, Ms. Papas, noticed my love of animals and gave me the great responsibility of taking care of our classroom pets: frogs, garter snakes, and baby chicks born in an incubator. She even let me take our garter snake home. Later, when I was a teenager living with my brother, I had two gerbils, two guinea pigs, a puppy and a rabbit--it was a stressful time in my life, and this assortment of pets brought a sense of calm and purpose that distracted me from my damaging pursuits, things like selling and smoking crack while dodging and sending bullets in return. It was an incredible trip. My mother shared with me the heartbreaking and traumatic things she experienced in her childhood and teenage years, and my heart burst open with a compassion that I had never experienced at that level. I shared things from my time in prison and my life after and my mother wept in my arms. By taking time to understand her story, I was able to make sense of my own. We hugged tightly before we departed from White Oaks, her heading back to Detroit and me heading back to LA. 134 \fStill reflecting on that letter I’d received from the man who shot me, I found myself writing to her after the trip: Dear Mama I have always dreamed of learning your story in your own words, through your eyes, heart, and spirit. I have dreamed of a moment in time when I could sit in your presence, feel your laughter from deep within, and witness you experiencing expanded joy. I have dreamed of watching you discover new things as you rediscover the boy, now turned man that is your youngest son, while holding your warm hands in mine. I have dreamed of the day when I could say ‘I love you, Mama’ eﬀortlessly and free of any attachments outside of the fact that you carried me and my siblings in your womb. I have dreamed of the day when we could sit in silence by a river, listening to the magic of nature swirling around us. I have dreamed of sharing the beauty of sunrises and the delightful taste of a perfectly baked oatmeal cookie. I have dreamed of listening to you tell me entertaining stories of your upbringing and discovering where my own ability to tell stories comes from. I have dreamed of the day when I 135 \fcan look in your face and see my own features reflected back. I have dreamed of the day when I can stand in front of you as a changed human, present father, and grown man and know that you see all of who I have become. I have dreamed of reaching the level of healing that allows me to be fully present in love and appreciation for whatever time we have on this mortal coil called earth. I dreamed, I dreamed, I dreamed until my actions made dreams a reality.” Love your baby boy Shaka Forgiveness is messy, often incomplete, and so diﬃcult—and it doesn’t have to be an absolute. If we think of forgiveness as a process, not a destination, then we will open the letter, but maybe not reply to it; we’ll write a letter, and perhaps expect no answer, and that will be just fine. What I took away from the experience with my mother is something I think you will find helpful on your journey. Be open to expressing your desires even though it may be extremely difficult and 136 \fmake you feel vulnerable. Let yourself try to forgive deeply while avoiding an expectation that a person will change because we forgive them. Let your forgiveness be forgiveness for you. Receiving Terrence’s letter and recognizing his humanity didn’t absolve him of responsibility for the pain he caused, but it allowed me to let go of my anger and find peace within myself, while finally putting a face to the ghost that for years had floated around in the background of my life. Drilling Down In my journey toward healing, I’ve discovered a series of affirmations and actions that have become my guiding light—steps toward reclaiming my peace and freedom. First, I remind myself that I am inherently deserving of my own healing. There’s no condition, no justification required for this truth—it simply is. Healing is not something I need to earn; it is my right as a human being. I acknowledge that I am worthy of freedom from the pains that no longer exist in the physical realm but still linger in my spirit. These 137 \finvisible wounds—memories of harm, moments of betrayal—may not be visible to the world, but they have left their mark. And yet, I recognize that I have the power to release them, to stop carrying their weight. I extend forgiveness to myself, knowing that it is never too late to grant myself the gift of self-love. I forgive myself for any delays, any moments when I didn’t think I was ready to let go. I’ve come to understand that liberation doesn’t adhere to a timeline—it arrives when I’m ready to receive it. And today, in this very moment, I make a bold and radical choice: I forgive those who have harmed me. I do this not because I owe it to anyone, not because it’s expected of me, but because I recognize that I deserve this gift. Forgiveness is not about them—it is about me. By releasing my grip on pain, I am claiming something invaluable: my freedom, my peace, and my future. Gut Check Acknowledge Your Feelings 138 \fForgiveness begins with recognizing your own worthiness. How much do you believe you deserve the freedom of peace, joy, and prosperity? This belief shapes your commitment to achieving profound liberation. Here are some steps I took on my journey toward forgiveness, steps I continue to take. Acknowledge the Depth of Your Hurt. Don't just use angry language to describe your pain. Give your feelings real, specific language. When I reflected on the man who shot me, I dissected my emotions: I was afraid because I didn't know the shooter's face, but he knew mine: I was hurt because what I was shot over seemed trivial, yet I believed my life held more significance. I was sad because I felt betrayed, and I was angry because I couldn't seek revenge. By laying out these feelings on paper, I broke them into manageable pieces. Visualize Life without Negative Emotions Ask yourself, how could this lead to being \"angrier, sadder, and more fearful\"? Can you imagine being happier, more successful, and 139 \fmore fulfilled? Visualizing this alternative reality can be a powerful motivator for forgiveness. When I began to visualize the relationship I desired with my mother, a warmth swept over me, as though I was a baby being swaddled in the softest blanket. I imagined us laughing, talking and crying over the simplest and most complex things in life. In that visualization the thing that resonated the most with me was the image of myself with the widest gap-toothed smile Meditate Daily on Your Desired Life Engage in daily meditation, focusing on the life you envision without the burden of anger, sadness, hurt, and revenge. This practice can help reinforce your commitment to forgiveness and your journey toward emotional freedom. In this mediation I see myself soaring high in the sky with the lightness of a feather or moving freely through water, because all that I desire for myself has come true. It’s a life of emotional and spiritual wealth that allows me to just be. Practice Saying \"I Forgive You\" 140 \fVerbalize your forgiveness. Speaking these words aloud allows the feeling to permeate your being in a profound way. Initially, it may make you feel vulnerable, like you're losing a protective shield. It took me some time before I truly felt it in my body. When I finally said it to my mother, it was liberating for both of us. With the man who shot me, the furthest I've gotten is writing it on paper (which I’ve not sent to him) but it feels just as liberating. Acknowledge and Let Go of Resurfacing Emotions When old emotions try to sneak up on you, acknowledge them without allowing them to take root. Instead, reflect on your forgiveness mantra and commit to forgiving without attaching conditions to it. Whenever those old feelings pop up, instead of stuffing them down, I lift them up, acknowledge them and firmly say to them “You don’t belong here anymore and you damn sure can’t stay here”. Create Your Own Forgiveness Mantra 141 \fCraft a personal forgiveness mantra that resonates with your journey. Repeating this mantra can help reinforce your commitment to forgiveness and emotional healing. I can’t share mine, because it’s personal to me. However, you can create one that says something to this effect “I forgive and in equal measure I recognize I am worthy of forgiveness. Maintain a Forgiveness Journal Consider keeping a journal dedicated to forgiveness. Write down your thoughts, feelings, and reflections on your forgiveness journey. Documenting your progress can be a powerful tool for selfdiscovery and healing. Remember that forgiveness is a transformative process that starts with acknowledging your worthiness. It's a journey toward emotional liberation and the path to experiencing the freedom of peace, joy, and prosperity in your life. 142 \f143 \fChapter Six Resilience \"It doesn't matter if a million people tell you what you can't do, or if ten million tell you no. If you get one yes from God, that's all you need.” -Tyler Perry I was on day three of fasting in solitary. I quietly declined each meal, even as my stomach clenched with hunger. For three days straight, I survived on nothing but tepid water from the sink and cherry cough drops from the commissary. I had fasted before—for spiritual reasons, for discipline—but this time was different. This was not about faith. This was about survival. I was preparing my body for the possibility that the prison officers would one day decide to stop feeding me. I had assaulted one of their own, and I knew payback wasn’t beyond them. If they wanted to punish me, they had options. They could starve me outright, or, worse, put me on food restriction with the horrid 144 \fconcoction known as \"food loaf,\" a hardened brick of everything from that day’s menu mashed together into something barely fit for human consumption. I refused to be at their mercy. The thought of what could come was terrifying, but in taking control of my own suffering, I found something unexpected: power. By voluntarily weakening my body, I was strengthening my mind. I was proving to myself that I could endure. I was vulnerable, but I was not powerless. That’s why I did it every month. Like clockwork, I would go three days without food, forcing my body to adjust, training my mind to push past hunger. Each time, I reminded myself: If I can survive this by choice, I can survive it if it’s forced upon me. I was inoculating myself against fear—starving out my own anxiety before anyone else could use it against me. It was only later that I realized I had unknowingly followed a lesson Seneca wrote to his friend Lucilius in Letter 18 of his Moral Letters to Lucilius. Seneca, one of Rome’s wealthiest and most powerful men, believed that true strength came not from luxury but from preparing for hardship. He urged Lucilius to regularly expose 145 \fhimself to discomfort to remind himself that he could survive without comfort. \"Set aside now and then a number of days during which you will be content with the scantest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: Is this the condition that I feared?\" Seneca’s point was simple: He wanted Lucilius to understand that wealth and comfort were illusions of security. If we train ourselves to endure hardship, we free ourselves from the fear of losing it. In that solitary cell, with nothing but hunger and time, I had unknowingly done the same. I had embraced weakness before it could be forced upon me. And in doing so, I had turned it into something else entirely: resilience. In a culture that plasters the word “grit” across T-shirts and coffee mugs, let me tell you—resilience is more than a catchy slogan or a motivational rallying cry for your sales team. Resilience is as much a spiritual principle as it is a psychological orientation. To get 146 \fthrough the hard stuff, overcome obstacles, and truly break through, you must dig deep into the parts of yourself that others can’t see. Like Winston Churchill may or may not have once said, “If you're going through hell, keep going.” Did it take grit to make it through my prison sentence, publish my first book, or create my first job? Absolutely. But that grit wasn’t just surface-level determination. It was rooted in a hardcore belief I arrived at through sheer will and unrelenting resolve. About a year into my prison sentence, I began to take exercise seriously. Before then, I’d stuck mostly to pushups and sit-ups in my cell. But at Standish Maximum Security, I started to push myself further—I began doing pullups and trying my hand at distance running. When I first started, I could barely manage one or two pullups and could hardly run two laps around the track, which was only half a mile. 147 \fThe first week was rough. Each day, I came out and saw almost no improvement. My body felt weak, and doubt crept into my mind. Why even try when it felt like I was going nowhere? Then one day, I saw something that changed my perspective— not just on training, but on life itself. It was during the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, and the world was watching when Derek Redmond faced a moment of devastating pain. He was running the 400-meter semifinal when he tore his hamstring and collapsed on the track. Everyone thought his race was over. But instead of quitting, Derek stood up, limped forward, and kept going. The pain was written all over his face, but he refused to stop. And when his father ran onto the track to support him, the two of them crossed the finish line together. I’ll never forget that moment. It wasn’t about winning—it was about finishing, about refusing to let failure define him. Derek’s story reminded me of something Dieter F. Uchtdorf once said: “It is your reaction to adversity, not the adversity itself, that determines how your life’s story will develop.” 148 \fFrom that day forward, I approached training with a new mindset. It wasn’t about where I started—it was about my willingness to keep going. I kept doing pullups until I could crank out sets with ease. I pushed myself to run farther each week, until I could complete laps without losing my breath. A year later, back at the Michigan Reformatory, where they had free weights, I started at the bottom again. My goal was to one day lift 225 pounds. It took years of consistent effort, but I eventually worked my way up, maxing out at 455 pounds and doing sets of fifteen with 225. I became one of the most respected trainers on the yard. But what mattered most wasn’t the physical strength I gained—it was the mental resilience I built along the way. And mental resilience turned out to be my path to freedom. “What else can you do with your mind?” Tom's question cut through the grunts of the weightlifters, the thud of the basketball bouncing on the carpeted court, and the stream of profanity echoing off the walls of the recreation center at 149 \fthe Michigan Reformatory—a place that was its own chaotic universe within the old walled prison. I'd been working for Tom as a recreation clerk for nearly a year, scheduling intramural sports events, ignoring the high stakes gambling by the pool tables, and making sure the frequent fights didn’t get out of hand. The Rec Center was the place where I operated my hustles, caught up with my homies, and stayed abreast of what was going on out on the yard. On Saturday mornings we ran pick-up games for the best ballers on the compound, during the week we ran baseball and football games between teams from the different cell blocks. It was one of the only jobs I had in prison that I enjoyed. I had access to everything and working for Tom was like working for your cool uncle, who let you get away with things your parents would never allow. Tom wasn't like most of the staff. He wasn't interested in fights or the gambling. He never preached or told us how to live our lives. Instead, he cracked jokes, talked to us about life on the outside or asked us questions that made us think. His challenge—\"What else 150 \fcan you do with your mind?\"—wasn't just a casual inquiry; it was a turning point for me. It forced me to pause and reflect on my capabilities. Tom one day told me he’d read an article I had written for The Hill Top News, our official prison newspaper. After jokingly quizzing me about whether I had written it or plagiarized it, he got serious and deep with me for the first of what would be many profound conversations. I told Tom that I had only written the article in the paper because a friend who worked at the paper asked me to write something, after his main writer got transferred out. \"You're smart, Shaka. You're a natural leader. People will follow you—you just must figure out where you want to lead them,\" Tom told me. His words started me on a journey of self-discovery, writing, and, most importantly, resilience many years later. But this didn’t happen overnight. It took five years after I left Tom at the Michigan Reformatory to find myself revisiting his question: “What else can you do with your mind?” There was power in that question. 151 \fIt acknowledged me as a person of worth and gave me something deep to ponder and eventually act on. Six years later sitting in solitary confinement, I began to dream of a life beyond the bars. I had been journaling and unearthing the past, but now I dared to dream of the future in an environment where most dreams are nightmares. I had a burning desire to write a book, but I didn't have a laptop, a typewriter, or even a proper pen. All I had was the vision and determination to do something meaningful with my mind. Completing a manuscript would be a symbolic expression that not only could I finish something tangible, but I could start the journey toward transforming my life. So, I picked up my flimsy handmade ink pen, rolled it in paper and started scribbling out my thoughts on whatever paper I could find. Each page led me one step closer toward the new life I was creating. As the saying goes, “You can't achieve what you can't conceive.” I had heard those words many times. When I started to write my goals into existence, my fear and mental paralysis began to lift. When I shared my goals and dreams with the right people— 152 \fthose who challenged and supported me—they started to crystallize in my mind, which led to me acting steps. It also gave those others permission to dream courageously. In prison, books and writing were my escape and my education. I wrote every day and devoured philosophy and strategy, reading everything from Sun Tzu’s The Art of War to Machiavelli’s The Prince. The system was designed to limit how much we could become empowered: the wardens banned certain books and limited access to information. But I knew that to survive, I had to sharpen my mind, think critically, and stay ahead of anything I thought would hold me back, including my own dark thoughts. I could feel the impact the books were having on me, by how optimistic I started to feel inside. It was like the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel, except for me, each book was like a sliver of light inside the tunnel, guiding my steps. I could also see the impact of my reading showing up in the things I wrote in my journal. Philosophy was challenging me emotionally and intellectually in a way that I’d never experienced. For the first time in my life, I was 153 \fasking myself tough questions. Will you push yourself when shit gets hard? How will you navigate this environment without resulting to violence? What are you willing to do to maximize your potential? I was reading deep shit and loving it. I loved the stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius, especially his Meditations. Up until then, I never thought about the mastery of emotions as a tool of power and personal agency. I loved the arguments of the Sophists, because they reminded me of the verbal battles the men and I had in the Law Library. I even changed the names while reading in Socrates' dialogues to make them more accessible. Instead of Glaucon, I used names like Tyrone, and instead of the Cave Allegory, I changed it to the Basement Allegory. Anything that challenged me to critically assess myself, remove all excuses, and master my mind, drew me in. I will never forget one day while reading James Allen’s As a Man Thinketh: \"You will become as small as your controlling desire; as great as your dominant aspiration.\" I read the sentence over and over before I was struck by the thought that I needed to write to the 154 \fWarden and try to convince him to let me out of solitary. If I was to get out of prison I had to first get back to the general population. For many years my controlling desire was to fight those who angered me, but in that moment my dominant aspiration was to get out of solitary confinement, so that, like they promise Army recruits, I could be all that I could be. I wrote a letter to the Warden, not just to ask if he would let me out of solitary, but to declare my intention to live on my own new terms. The letter went something like this: Dear Warden, As you read this letter, I hope you will consider this essential question: What do you believe is true? When I first entered prison, I resolved never to follow the rules, to ignore any authority figure that contradicted my rebellious spirit. After nearly nine years in prison and 35 misconducts, it's evident that I have kept my word. So, if you acknowledge my commitment to my word in a negative light, could you also believe in my sincerity about positive intentions? 155 \fIf truth is what matters most in our dialogue, I encourage you to reflect on what I'm about to propose. Should you, on the off chance, allow me to reenter general population, I give you my word that for the remainder of my incarceration, I will dedicate myself solely to nurturing my writing talent and mentoring the young guys on the yard—gifts I discovered in this place and wish to share with prisoners and then the world. Given your extensive experience in corrections, if you recognize that a person's word can be a testament to their character, regardless of past negativity, I hope you will give me a chance. Advocate for my release, and I promise to mentor other inmates upon my release, to publish the books I have written by hand, and to become an inspiration to many across the globe. It all hinges on one thing: your trust in my word. Unexpectedly and surprisingly, I received a positive response from the Warden. Writing that letter was how I ended up getting set free. I thought to myself “This philosophical shit really works!” I had manifested myself back into the general population, even though it 156 \ftook some time for it to materialize. Thinking and speaking it into existence was part of the process, but action and follow through brought it all together Nothing came without adversity. After finishing my book, I got down on the floor of my cell and yelled under the door. “Does anyone want to read this book I just wrote?” Someone down the tier responded back. “Don’t nobody want to read that shit, this ain’t Oprah.” For a second, I was taken aback and felt the old familiar anger surface: I could have this person stabbed when he got back to the yard. But instead, I did something better. I allowed his words to challenge me to think about exactly what I wanted from this writing thing, beyond having just anyone read it. I took his words and turned them into an audacious new goal: I wanted to write something worthy of Oprah Winfrey herself taking the time out to read it. When I got out of prison after nineteen years, seven in solitary confinement, the world didn't exactly roll out the red carpet. I found 157 \fmyself standing in Rouge Park on the Westside of Detroit, trying to sell my first self-published book. I felt out of place in oversized prison clothes and glasses that didn't quite fit. I’d expected the inside to be tough, but I didn't anticipate the cold shoulder from the streets. I remember one guy scoffing at me, saying, \"People around here don't read.\" But I didn't fold. I'd hustled in prison and on the streets—I wasn't about to let a little rejection stop me. I shot back with a smile, \"Maybe not, but I'm sure someone you care about does. This would make a great gift, or at minimum you can place it under the leg of a wobbly table or couch.\" He laughed, and by the end of our conversation, I had $30 in my pocket. That's when I realized I needed a strategy that included one of my strongest tools besides my pen: speaking. I started volunteering to speak at local schools, Job Corps and anywhere else people would have me. Every time I spoke to an audience, I sold out all the books I brought with me. I wasn't just selling books, I was sharing a 158 \fstory, creating a connection, casting a vision. If I could get in front of people, I could make them see the value in my words. One day, I received the list of attendees to a private event in Utah where I’d be speaking. I was floored — Mellody Hobson and George Lucas were going to be in the room. I knew I had to make an impression, and I decided that getting my book into the hands of the hundred participants was the way to do it. But there was one problem: I didn’t have much money. Between my business and personal accounts, there wasn’t enough to comfortably cover the cost of giving away the hundred books, which came to $2,500. It was a big risk and a big pivot. After all, I was about to give away books to people who could clearly afford to pay for them. But I believed in my message, so I used nearly all the cash I had to print and ship the books so they could be given out as I took the stage. When I finished my talk, I felt at peace. Even if nothing came of it, I knew I had left it all on the stage—I’d given it my all. 159 \fLater that day, a sharply dressed man approached me. He looked serious. I braced myself, expecting harsh words. But instead, he cracked a smile and said, “I’m upset with you.” Before I could ask why, he continued, “My wife was in the room reading your book when we were supposed to be hanging out!” That man’s wife, Andrea Wishom, soon became a dear friend. After reading my book, without telling me, Andrea passed it along to Oprah. A year later—just five years after I’d gotten out of prison—I received a call that would change everything. Oprah wanted to interview me on “Super Soul Sunday.” Months later, I flew to California for the filming. When I arrived at the hotel, I felt like a kid on the night before the first day of school. I laid out my clothes on the bed and even tried them on, sitting in a chair and imagining myself across from Oprah, preparing for one of the biggest moments of my life. I wore a light blue Polo sweater, a pair of nice jeans, Ferragamo loafers and some cool socks. The next morning, I headed to her home, surprisingly calm—at least until the 160 \fgates to The Promised Land (her estate) opened. That’s when the old narratives started creeping in. What if she brings up my crime and lays into me? What if she’s afraid of me? What if she judges me? As these thoughts raced through my mind, my nerves got the best of me, and I almost started shaking. But then I was stopped in my tracks by a simple, silly question: “What do you even call her—Ms. Winfrey? Mama O? Oprah?” The thought made me laugh, and before I could come up with an answer, Oprah herself appeared. She called out my name in a sing-song voice: “Shaka, Shaka, Shaka!” She wrapped me in a warm embrace, and in that moment, I knew I was safe. I knew my truth would be handled with care. For the next three hours, Oprah guided me through my story. She drew out my truth with compassion, and we shared both laughter and tears. When I returned home, I was on cloud nine. I was on my way to celebrate when I received a call—from Oprah. She said she 161 \fwanted to make sure I had her personal number and told me, “I want us to be friends.” I couldn’t believe it. Oprah—the most heralded and extraordinary woman in the world—wanted to be my friend. From that moment on, we began exchanging texts and occasional calls. Yeah, I be texting Oprah. Over the years, Oprah and I have worked on projects together, reached out to each other when the world felt like it was falling apart, and kept each other excited about the power of the written word. She has been an inspiration, a collaborator, and, most importantly, a true friend. Every now and then, a small and petty part of me can’t help but wonder out loud: “Where’s that guy who told me this wasn’t Oprah?” The Business of Resilience That hustle—the grit, the determination, the resilience—I carried it with me into the business world. After leaving my role as 162 \fExecutive Director of ARC (Anti-Recidivism Coalition), I founded my own executive leadership and storytelling consultancy, Shaka Senghor Inc, and I found myself living my dream. Business was taking off. I had three six-figure contracts. And then the pandemic hit. In a matter of weeks, all the contracts were rescinded. Everything I'd built started to vanish. In business, we throw around words like \"grit\" and \"resilience\" to inspire teams. But until you've stared down real adversity, you don't fully grasp what those words mean. I knew what it meant to be resilient because I'd lived it. The pandemic was just another challenge, another opportunity to adapt. That's what resilience is— finding new ways to succeed when the world tells you to stop. In my case, when the pandemic gutted my new business, I shifted into the corporate world. Of course, corporations were facing their own reckoning: I joined TripActions, now known as Navan, whose travel business had been decimated almost overnight. But CEO Ariel Cohen, never lost sight of the bigger opportunity. He told 163 \fus that travel would return, and when it did, we'd be in the best position to serve the world. He was right. Navan rebounded and Ariel's leadership during that difficult time taught me that resilience in corporate American required the same focus, determination, and imagination required to get out and stay out of prison. It requires you to assess your situation honestly and learn from others who've faced adversity and come out on the other side. Being part of a team with that mindset inspired me. It reminded me of what I'd done with my mind all those years before in prison— reshaping my thinking, educating myself, and building resilience through every setback. When I left Navan, I knew that whatever I built next would be even better because I had the confidence, the grit, and the resilience to make it happen. Resilience in the Stories That Shaped Me It’s one thing to talk about resilience, but living it isn’t always easy. Seeing past the setbacks requires you to dig deep. In my case, 164 \fmuch of the fuel to keep going has come from the inspiration of others’ stories. Back in 2017 during a trip to Memphis, I visited the Stax Museum to see Isaac Hayes' legendary gold-plated Cadillac Eldorado. I'd always been a Hayes fan—his music felt like soul food. But after watching a documentary on Stax Records, my admiration deepened. The label wasn't just a hit factory; it was a testament to entrepreneurial resilience. Al Bell, who played a pivotal role in Stax's success, watched the label nearly crumble after losing its entire music catalog to a distribution deal with Atlantic Records, a failed partnership with CBS Records, and financial overextension. Imagine that—the legacy and the revenue stream destroyed. But instead of walking away, Bell doubled down. He rebuilt Stax from the ground up, gambling on new talent and fresh music. The result? A resurgence that produced some of the greatest soul music ever made. He later went on to produce hits like the rap group Tag Team’s \"Whoomp! (There It Is)\" 165 \fand Prince's \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,\" proving that even massive setbacks are just temporary if you stay relentless. That's the kind of resilience that inspired me during my darkest days inside. When you're isolated, with nothing but your thoughts and a few books, you have two choices: sink or rise. I chose to rise. I clung to the stories of those who had done the same people like Nelson Mandela, who spent twenty-seven years in prison but never lost sight of his greater mission. He once said, \"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.\" That quote kept me alive in my toughest moments because I understood that resilience isn't about avoiding failure; it's about how you bounce back. I dove into incredibly insightful books by brilliant and badass women, like Maya Angelou’s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Chin-Ning Chu’s Thick Face, Black Heart. Chu wrote: “The ability to achieve your highest potential is directly related to your ability to battle through adversity, to develop an indestructible will, and to 166 \fembrace the reality that success often demands a fearless heart and a thick face.” I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X and found the strength to redefine myself, to imagine a future where I was more than just another statistic. Malcolm showed me that no matter where you start, your story isn't set in stone. You have the power to rewrite it, but it takes grit, vision, and even when you waver, with enough belief in yourself, you can push through. It wasn't just autobiographies that fueled me; other nonfiction and fiction writings played their part, too. Books like Sidney Sheldon's Master of the Game, Stephen King's The Stand and J A Rogers World’s Great Men of Color taught me that resilience shows up in the unlikeliest of characters—those who face insurmountable odds but still find a way to push through. Hannibal crossing the Alps on elephants wasn't just military brilliance; it was audacity. It's about believing that even when the road is blocked, there's another way through. 167 \fLife will invariably present us with opportunities to challenge our beliefs, grow stronger in our conviction, or buckle under the pressure. These choices, though uncomfortable, are the real gateways to our personal liberation. It is up to us, and us alone, to decide the direction we wish to take. Amid discomfort, chaos and unsettling moments I had a choice. It was one of my biggest life lessons – in each moment we are in, we are always making a choice. Do we forge ahead in our minds or slink into that vacuous space that tells us we have no choice? Every Setback Is a Setup for a Comeback When I think about Al Bell rebuilding Stax, or Nelson Mandela surviving twenty-seven years in prison, Maya Angelou writing over thirty books, Chin-Ning Chu teaching the power of resilience and strategic toughness, or Hannibal charging through the Alps, I'm reminded of what I've had to do in my own life. When I was in prison, I didn't have access to technology, a publishing deal, or even the belief that people would care about what I had to say. But I wrote anyway. Later I hustled my books out of the 168 \ftrunk of my car, facing rejection after rejection, until finally, one ended up in Oprah's hands. That didn't happen because I had some master plan—it happened because I refused to stop. At that time there was no agent or publicist. All I had was pure grit, determination, the gift of serendipity, and the willingness to pivot instead of quitting when things weren’t working. Resilience is knowing that setbacks are setups for comebacks. It's that moment when you're at the end of your rope but find a way to tie a knot and hang on. It's taking that small, intentional step forward when the road seems blocked, trusting that persistence will lead to progress. Resilience is about understanding that even when the world is stacked against you, the power to rise is within you. It's about looking for the Al Bells, the Mandelas, the Angelous, Ning-Chus and the Malcolm-Xs and recognizing that their stories aren't so different from yours. They all faced moments where they could have folded, but they didn't. They endured, and because of that, they achieved greatness. 169 \fA Vision for the Future When I look back at the path I've traveled—from scribbling notes in a prison cell to hustling books on the streets, to stepping into the business world—I see a pattern. Every setback was an opportunity to grow. Every rejection fueled my next move. It's not about avoiding adversity; it's about embracing it, learning from it, and using it to propel you. Resilience isn't a skill; it's a mindset that requires nurturing. You don’t just get resilient, you go through shit, get stronger, go through more shit, get stronger, and when faced with more shit, realize your mind, body and spirit working together is what it’s about. It's the ability to take life's punches and keep moving forward and swinging back. The Lesson is in the Struggle Resilience is in the struggle. It's in choosing to rise every time you fall. Whether it's overcoming the challenges of prison, navigating the cutthroat world of business, or facing personal hardships, the 170 \fpower to overcome lies within us. We just have to tap into it by acknowledging what we are going through, meditating on it, praying and developing a working and practical plan of action that keeps us moving forward one thought at a time. So, ask yourself, \"What else can you do with your mind?\" The answer might just change your life. Resilience isn’t a destination—it’s a journey, a process you learn and relearn through life’s inevitable challenges. It’s not something you’re born with; it’s something you build, moment by moment, choice by choice. Every setback I’ve faced has been an opportunity to dig deeper, to see what I’m really made of. Watching Derek Redmond finish that race with his father’s help, taught me that resilience starts in the mind. It’s not about avoiding pain or failure—it’s about choosing to finish, no matter how broken you feel. That moment changed my perspective on what it means to keep going, even when the odds seem insurmountable. Resilience isn’t just about pushing through hardship. It’s about recognizing that every adversity is a chance to grow stronger, both 171 \fmentally and spiritually. Each time I found myself in a tough spot— whether it was the prison yard, solitary confinement, or the streets of Detroit—I learned that the key to getting through wasn’t in running from the pain but leaning into it and learning from it. At the heart of resilience is vision and determination. It’s the ability to see a better future, even when your current reality seems bleak. Whether it was my goal to lift 225 pounds, write a book in solitary confinement, or get out and sell that book to people who doubted me, it was the clarity of my vision that gave me the strength to keep going. But resilience isn’t built in isolation. It’s often the people who believe in us—like Derek Redmond’s father—who help us get back up. I wouldn’t have made it without mentors like Tom, who asked me what I could do with my mind, or Andrea, who passed my book to Oprah. Resilience is as much about building connections as it is about inner strength. Most importantly, resilience isn’t linear—it’s circular. Every challenge build on the last, teaching you how to navigate the next 172 \fone. Each time I stumbled and got back up, I was training myself to see setbacks as setups for comebacks. And so, the question becomes: How do you build resilience in your own life? Here are five action steps to get started. Keys to Build Resilience 1. Define Your Vision o Think about one goal or challenge you’re currently facing. Write it down in clear, actionable terms. Visualize your finish line and what success looks like for you. o Example: If your goal is to start a new career, write down exactly where you want to be in five years, what steps you need to take, and why it matters to you. 2. Take One Small Step Every Day o Break your goal into manageable pieces and commit to taking one small action each day, even if it’s 173 \funcomfortable or hard. Progress, no matter how small, builds momentum. o Example: If your goal is to get healthier, start with five minutes of exercise a day or swapping one unhealthy snack for something nutritious. 3. Learn From Your Setbacks o Reflect on a time when you faced failure or rejection. Ask yourself: What did I learn from that experience? How did it make me stronger? Use those lessons to guide you forward. o Example: Keep a journal where you document challenges and write about how you overcame them or what they taught you. 4. Build Your Support System o Identify the people in your life who uplift and inspire you. Share your goals with them and ask for their support or guidance. Surround yourself with voices that encourage resilience. 174 \fo Example: Set up a regular check-in with a friend, mentor, or coach to hold you accountable and offer perspective. 5. Reframe Your Mindset o Shift your focus from obstacles to opportunities. Instead of asking, “Why is this happening to me?” ask, “What can I learn from this? How can this make me stronger?” o Example: Practice gratitude by writing down three things you’re grateful for each day, even during tough times. Gratitude helps you see challenges in a more positive light. Resilience isn’t about being unbreakable; it’s about finding the strength to put yourself back together, piece by piece, every time life tries to tear you down. It’s about finishing your race, even if you have to limp across the finish line. The five steps above are tools to help 175 \fyou dig deep and build the kind of strength that carries you forward—not just for today, but for a lifetime. 176 \fChapter Seven Hope and Composure \"Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering, ‘It will be happier.’\" Lord Alfred Tennyson I was about three years out of prison when I went out with some friends to celebrate. We decided to hit up a Detroit Cabaret, one of those classic weekend events where promoters host a party, and the city shows up dressed to the nines. Cabarets are as Detroit as coney dogs and Motown—longstanding traditions where guests bring their own bottles of liquor, buy chicken wings and fries from the host, and dance the night away. That night, it was summer, so the party had an all-white theme. The crowd was sharp—women in flowy dresses, men in linen suits, everyone looking like they had stepped off a runway. We were all just there to enjoy the night, but as we left the venue, the energy shifted. A heated argument broke out between a young man and a security guard in the parking lot. Their voices rose, and the guard made a dangerous escalation: “I’m going to my car to get my gun.” 177 \fThe threat was real, and suddenly, everyone was on edge. People started piling into their cars, some screeching out of the lot to avoid what might come next. I had a choice: jump in my car and leave with the rest of the crowd or try to deescalate the situation. The stakes were high, higher than anything I’d faced while diffusing conflicts in prison. This wasn’t just about calming someone down—there was a gun involved. But something inside me pushed me forward. I walked up to the young man, standing tall and rigid with anger, and met his gaze. “Young brother, it’s not worth it. Let’s get you home to your family,” I said, my voice steady and calm. For a moment, I wasn’t sure if my words would reach him. But then I saw his shoulders slump, the tension leaving his body like air from a balloon. Behind me, my friends Calvin and Jay worked to calm the security guard, who had made his way toward his car but was now hesitating. 178 \fAfter a long, tense pause, the young man said, “I’m going to listen to you, OG.” We helped him to his car, making sure he got in safely. Then, finally, I walked back to my own car, my legs heavy with the energy that had drained from me during those few intense moments. As I buckled myself in, I let out a long breath. That was a close call, I thought. But that moment taught me two powerful lessons. First, in moments of intense conflict, sometimes all it takes is the hope of being seen and understood to shift the energy. And second, maintaining my own composure isn’t just empowering for me—it’s empowering for others. I don’t recommend this call to action to anyone, but in that moment its what I was called to do. As a kid, growing up watching Mister Rogers, I learned about calmness and compassion as he thoughtfully and carefully discussed tough subjects. I never imagined those same lessons would play out in a parking lot in Detroit. But there I was, leaning on those childhood teachings. Mister Rogers showed me that calmness 179 \fisn’t passive—it’s active. It’s about meeting tension with presence, fear with understanding, and chaos with clarity. In that parking lot, amidst the shouting and threats, I wasn’t just diffusing a conflict—I was honoring those lessons. Composure and hope don’t just steady you; they steady those around you. Hope was one of the tools I used to break out of my internal prison. It wasn’t just a feeling or a vague wish—it was a force that kept me going when everything around me felt hopeless. Hope showed up in slivers of light, breaking through the cracks, reminding me that there was something worth fighting for on the other side. It wasn’t about survival alone—it was about confronting the chains I couldn’t see: the shame, fears, and anger I carried, and the weight of narratives that told me my past defined me. Hope gave me the courage to believe those chains could be broken. I found hope in unexpected places—in books that told stories of resilience, in fictional heroes who fell and rose again, and in the men working tirelessly in the prison law library to reclaim their freedom. I saw it in athletes who refused to quit, who kept getting up 180 \fno matter how many times they were knocked down. I found it in music--my sanctuary--where lyrics and rhythms reminded me I wasn’t alone. Those fragments of hope became lifelines, helping me imagine a life beyond my circumstances. Hope rarely arrives all at once, but if you stay open to it, it will find you. It might come from a movie, a person, or even a song. Shawshank Redemption is Illmatic I finally saw The Shawshank Redemption after thirty years. It’s funny how often people asked me about that film, assuming I’d seen it because of my time in prison. “Is that what it’s really like?” they’d say, as if every prison experience can be summed up in a Hollywood script. I was in prison when the movie was released. Prison banned movies and TV shows about incarceration, so while the world got to experience Shawshank, I was living my own version of it. When I finally watched it, decades later, one scene stuck with me like a memory I hadn’t lived but knew in my bones—the conversation between Andy and Red about the power of music. 181 \fAndy says, “That’s the beauty of music. They can’t take that away from you.” He talks about how music offers a refuge, something untouchable, something that transcends the prison walls. And in a place where you’re stripped down to nothing, that’s everything. Andy wasn’t just talking about music. He was talking about hope, about composure, about the parts of us that no one can steal, no matter how much they try. “Hope is a good thing,” Andy says. “Maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.” It’s wild to think that the same year Shawshank hit theaters, the greatest rap album of all time Illmatic landed in my life like a lifeline. I was at the Michigan Reformatory, three years deep into my sentence. The reformatory was a brutal place, a kind of gladiator school where survival wasn’t just physical—it was mental. I remember reading The Source magazine, seeing that Nas’ debut album had been given five mics—an honor only bestowed on the best of the best. That was all I needed to know. I ordered the cassette immediately and waited. 182 \fWhen it arrived, I was ready. Sitting on my bunk, I pressed play and went on a lyrical journey with Nas from my prison cell all the way over to Queensbridge. Nas’ adeptness at creating vivid images of inner city life, coupled with profound poetic insights into the human experience was a master class on what it means to be an artist. I’ll never forget the moment “One Love” came on. It was like Nas was speaking directly to me, straight to my soul, when he spat “What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid When the cops came, you shoulda slid to my crib” I jumped off of my bunk and started pacing the cells as the story unfolded. The raw and beautiful lyrics were a letter to a friend locked up, and at that moment. I felt like he was writing to me. I had felt abandoned, forgotten by so many people on the outside, from friends I hustled with to family members who treated me like a distant memory, but here was Nas—reminding me that he hadn’t forgotten us. That album became my anchor. Just like Andy’s music, Illmatic was my refuge and a source of hope. So much so that I rushed up to the recreation center and went to the shoe room and got the worst 183 \ftattoo ever for three dollars in prison tokens. I wanted to commemorate the album and its impact in a way that I would never forget. Instead of the elegant old English and Garamond font, my tattoo was punctured into my skin in scraggly blobs of ink with a crude DIY tattoo gun made of a tape player motor, guitar string and ink made from unidentified ingredients. Along with the raggedy lettering I added a dog biting through a chain to symbolize me breaking free. Instead of coming out like the Rottweiler image torn out of a magazine, it came out looking more like Fozzy the Bear. Despite the butchered tattoo, Illmatic helped me find my composure. It reminded me that no matter how chaotic life was, no matter how much they tried to strip me down, I still had my mind, my spirit, my hope. And just like Shawshank, Nas’ words reminded me that the world couldn’t take that from me unless I let them. Just over two decades later, through a series of serendipitous meetings, I was introduced to Ben Horowitz. At the time, Ben was preparing for an interview with Oprah at his company, a16z. During their conversation, he asked her a seemingly innocent 184 \fquestion: How do you get people to open up and cry during interviews? Oprah shared an anecdote and, in passing, mentioned the interview she and I had done on Super Soul Sunday. Intrigued, Ben later told his wife, Felicia, about the conversation and my story. Felicia, in turn, reached out to me via social media. I’ll never forget that first call with Felicia. She asked about my book, told me about Ben’s meeting with Oprah, and then casually asked, \"Are you familiar with my husband’s writing?\" I admitted I hadn’t yet read his book The Hard Thing about Hard Things or blogs, and she enthusiastically filled me in. Then she asked, \"What are you into?\" \"Reading and music,\" I said. \"Mostly hip-hop.\" \"Who’s your favorite artist?\" \"Nas,\" I answered without hesitation. “Wow, That’s Ben’s favorite as well. 185 \fFelicia and I wrapped up the conversation with some small talk before she extended an invitation: \"Next time you’re in the Bay, let’s have dinner.\" A few months later, I found myself in San Francisco. I reached out to Felicia, and she asked where I was staying. When I told her, she said, \"I’m right down the street at Glide Church. Step outside, turn left.\" At that moment, my curiosity kicked in. Who are these people, and why are they so interested in me? In hindsight, it made sense— my book was coming out, I was doing interviews—but at the time, I hadn’t connected the dots. I met Felicia at Glide, where she introduced me to Cecil Williams and Janice Mirikitani who founded the church. Afterward, we parted ways, but later, she texted: \"If you’re free tonight, let’s do dinner.\" I agreed, and as I was heading over to the restaurant, Felicia texted again: \"Actually, just come to the house.\" I switched the 186 \faddress in my app and the driver remarked that we were going to Silicon Valley. I’m going to be honest—when I first heard Silicon Valley, I imagined a valley full of titties. The only Silicon I knew about was in fake breasts from the Playboy magazines I read in prison, before they banned them. But as I drove through, the dark, tree-lined roads gave off a different kind of vibe. My Detroit instinct kicked in. What if this was a setup? I had seen Misery—I wasn’t about to get hobbled out in the woods. But once I arrived, my suspicions melted away. Their home was majestic, but more than that, they were down to earth. Ben was still on a call when I got in, so Felicia and I made small talk. When he finally joined us, Felicia immediately said, \"He loves Nas.\" Ben grinned. \"Nas is a friend of mine.\" I laughed, then told him the story behind my tattoo before pulling up my sleeve to show him. Ben nearly fell out of his chair laughing. My tattoo, faded and fuzzy, looked more like a bear than the image I had intended. 187 \f\"I gotta call Nas,\" he said. Right then and there, he dialed, and suddenly, I was talking to Nas himself, sharing my story. If it had ended there, I would have been satisfied. But it didn’t. Months later, Ben and Felicia invited me to a barbecue, mentioning that Nas would be there. When Nas arrived, we exchanged the universal Black man nod—quick, understated, What’s up? Not long after, Ben invited me to a Nas and Lauryn Hill concert. The night was already surreal, but then Dave Chappelle walked up and asked if anyone had a cigarette. I didn’t have any cigarettes, but I was happy to be talking to the legend himself. We laughed and traded jokes about him trying to find a cigarette, before enjoying the concert. That should have been enough. But it wasn’t over. One day, Ben hit me up again. \"Come through—Nas is stopping by.\" The three of us spent six hours together, just talking shop— hip-hop, culture, life. We were like teenagers, hyped up as we played 188 \fsong after song, dissecting every verse. Nas gave us back stories on albums and artist from the early days, and Ben and I shared our stories of the first time we heard different songs. What was apparent and refreshing was Nas was not only one of the greatest artists of all time, he was genuinely one of the biggest fans of the art form itself. Nas and I exchanged numbers before we departed, and texted each other periodically about books we were reading or thinking of reading. And then, years later, this happened Sekou was away for a few days, and I was sitting home alone in my office during the pandemic when Nas reached out to me. He asked me if I could write something for a song he was working on for his upcoming album. Holy shit, the greatest lyricists was inviting me to contribute my words to a project. Nasir Jones who had just won a Grammy for King’s Disease wanted me to contribute to King’s Disease II. Imagine that—Nas, the same artist whose lyrics had carried me through my hardest days, now giving me the opportunity to do the same for someone else. I imagined my friends and other 189 \fpeople serving time being shocked when they heard my voice come through the speakers. That was a moment where I had to draw on all the emotional strength I’d built over the years, to keep my shit together. When Nas sent the text, I responded, with a question. When do you need it? “I’m in the studio with the producer now,” he replied. I would later learn the producer was Hit Boy, the producer of Travis Scott’s Sicko Mode, Big Sean’s Deep Reverence and Nas' Grammy winning album. Holy shit, I had to get straight to it. Fuck, I had to deliver, and I had to deliver now. I put my phone down and jumped out of my chair in my office. I was hyped up and everything felt like a dream in slow motion. Yo, the greatest lyricist of all time asked me to join him on a song. Nas had given me the song title and a simple direction, just freestyle, but don’t rap. I laughed out loud when I went back and read the text again. I gathered myself and began reciting the words into my voice memo right then and there, I didn’t even take time to write the words down. I just spoke the words 190 \f“Keep your composure On city blocks and cell blocks Keep your composure Hold it down, hold it tight Hold it close, hold space for yourself It's the way of the ancestors Our elders, our artists Our OGs, our dreamers, our builders With each breath, internalize their successes Their struggles, their sense of self Their sense of overcoming And take that power forward with you in life Remind yourself of the magnitude of your good fortune which” is now a part of that Grammy-nominated album. Being a part of that album was a full-circle moment, a testament to the power of holding on to hope, to keeping your composure through the hardest times. It’s proof that when you stay grounded, when you refuse to break, life can take you places you never dreamed of. 191 \fThat lesson of composure, of holding steady, has played out in so many moments in my life. I think back to the time I went snorkeling in Maui. I’d never swum in the ocean before, and the waves were relentless. I was a good swimmer and even had a pool in my backyard, but this was different. Saltwater flooded my snorkel, and suddenly, I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t put my feet on solid ground. The water was deep. Panic started to rise in my chest, and for a split second, I thought, this is it. But then I remembered something: panic only makes things worse. So, I took a breath, I calmed myself. I removed the snorkel, started treading water, and swam back to the boat. It wasn’t heroic, it wasn’t grand—it was just composure. Sometimes you just need to hold on until you get to the other side. It’s not about pretending everything is fine or forcing yourself to feel strong—it’s about finding the grit to endure, even when the weight feels unbearable and things beneath your feet feel unstable. When Sherrod was murdered, I didn’t have the luxury of falling apart right away. When our dog Indy was killed, I felt the same tight 192 \fgrip on my emotions and tears, holding myself together for the sake of my family. And when Sekou was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, I had to hit the pause button on the fear, anger, and tears that burst from my eyes as I focused on the immediate task of being there for him. Being his father and his buoy. In those moments, I wasn’t just holding on for myself—I was holding on for everyone who needed me. It wasn’t about shutting down my emotions or pretending they didn’t exist. Instead, it was about acknowledging them, letting them rest in the background, and focusing on the task at hand until I could find a moment to let it all go. Holding on meant becoming a grounding space for my family. But composure doesn’t make you superhuman. It’s a delicate balance between strength and vulnerability. It’s about understanding that the tears you hold back in the moment will eventually need a place to land. And when that moment comes—when you are in your car or at home alone, when everyone is safe or in bed, when the immediate crisis has passed—you allow yourself to break apart, to feel all the feels, and to begin healing. Holding on is an act of 193 \fresilience but letting go when the time is right is an act of selfpreservation. In those times, I had to be my family’s rock and their safe space. I also had to break apart and put myself together in front of them. I had to give them hope, just like Nas’ music gave me hope all those years ago. Composure meant showing my son that even though life had just thrown him a massive curveball, we could handle it together. And that is what composure really is. Sometimes you just need to hold on until you can safely and completely fall apart, before putting yourself back together. It was twenty-seven years from Illmatic to Kings Disease II, twenty-seven years between that moment of me sitting in that cell and me sending Nas my voice memo of my spoken word over an iPhone. Composure isn’t just for personal tragedy—it’s also a critical tool in leadership, life, and business. Composure isn’t about ignoring challenges or pretending they don’t exist. It’s about confronting adversity head-on with clarity, focus, and a steady hand. Whether in life or in business, composure 194 \fis the foundation that allows us to make thoughtful decisions, inspire confidence, and move forward, even in the most uncertain of times. Like Andy Dufresne said in Shawshank: music, hope, and the things that can’t be taken from us are what keep us grounded. Hiphop has been my anchor, a source of strength and composure when the world around me was anything but stable. It’s taught me to hold onto the things that are mine—my voice, my story, my hope. Composure is also about embracing ambition unapologetically and allowing yourself to be driven by your passions and dreams. It’s about recognizing the power of hope and using it to fuel your journey, no matter where you are or what challenges you face. Composure as a Lifelong Practice In the end, composure is not a destination but a lifelong practice. It’s the art of balancing ambition with patience, of navigating the rip currents of life without losing your sense of self. It’s about standing firm in your identity, even when others try to impose their narratives on you. And it’s about knowing that, like the 195 \fmusic that played in the background of our lives, there’s something inside of us that no one can touch. It’s ours, and it’s enough. The lessons I’ve learned from hip-hop, from the triumphs and setbacks, and from my own journey have all contributed to my understanding of composure. It’s about staying true to who you are, holding onto hope, and pushing forward with unwavering determination while not losing your shit. And that, to me, is the ultimate expression of freedom. Gut Check Life has a way of testing us in ways we never expect. Whether it’s the chaos of a parking lot in Detroit, the isolation of a prison cell, or the uncertainty of a rebranding effort in the corporate world, every challenge forces us to dig deep and find something steady to hold onto. For me, that steadiness has often come from two sources: hope and composure. Hope is not just a fleeting feeling or a distant dream—it’s a force that anchors us when the waves of life threaten to pull us under. It’s the belief that even in the darkest moments, light can 196 \fbreak through the cracks. And composure? Composure is the tool that helps us navigate those moments. It’s not about shutting down or pretending everything is fine—it’s about holding steady, even when the world around us feels like it’s falling apart. The lessons I’ve learned about hope and composure weren’t just intellectual—they were forged in the fires of real life. From my time in prison, where hope was a lifeline, to moments in the outside world where composure helped me defuse conflict and lead with clarity, these lessons are deeply personal. And yet, they are universal. Here are five keys drawn from my journey that I hope will help you cultivate your own sense of hope and composure, no matter where you are or what challenges you face. Sometimes Hope Shows Up in the Smallest Moments Hope rarely arrives in grand gestures—it comes in fragments: a kind word, a song, a book, or even a memory. Like when Nas’ Illmatic brought me back to myself in prison, hope reminded me of 197 \fwhat was still possible. The smallest slivers of light can help us see the path forward. Composure Steadies You and Those Around You In the parking lot that night, I realized composure wasn’t just for me. When I held my ground and spoke calmly to that young man, it wasn’t just my energy that shifted—it was his, too. Composure is contagious; it creates space for others to feel safe and reconsider their choices. Hope Requires Action Hope isn’t passive—it’s not just sitting around and wishing for something better. It’s about taking deliberate steps toward what you believe is possible. Whether it’s writing letters from solitary confinement or showing up to sell books in Rouge Park, hope only works when you do. Composure Is a Lifelong Practice Composure isn’t something you master—it’s something you practice every day. It’s about holding steady in the moment and 198 \fmaking room to process later. Whether defusing a parking lot argument or facing personal tragedy, composure helps you carry on when emotions threaten to overwhelm you. Hope and Composure Together Create Freedom Hope is the vision of what’s possible, and composure is the tool that helps you get there. Together, they free you from the chaos of the moment and give you the power to move forward with clarity and purpose. They’re not just tools for survival—they’re tools for transformation. Keys to Build Hope and Composure 1. Anchor Yourself in Daily Rituals o Hope and composure thrive on consistency. Create a daily ritual—whether it’s journaling, meditating, or listening to music—that helps you stay grounded and connected to your purpose. 199 \fo Example: Take five minutes each morning to write down three things you’re hopeful about or grateful for. 2. Pause Before Reacting o In moments of tension or conflict, give yourself a beat to assess the situation before responding. This simple pause can shift your energy and prevent escalation. o Example: When someone provokes you, take a deep breath, count to three, and ask yourself, “What’s the best outcome here?” 3. Take Small, Consistent Steps Toward Your Vision o Don’t wait for everything to feel perfect before moving forward. Break your goals into small, manageable steps and commit to taking one each day, no matter how small. 200 \fo Example: If your goal is to write a book, commit to writing a hundred words daily, even if it’s rough. Progress builds hope. These lessons and steps aren’t just about surviving challenges—they’re about thriving through them. By practicing hope and composure, you can create the space to face life’s difficulties with courage and clarity, turning even the hardest moments into opportunities for growth. 201 \fChapter Eight Love \"To love well is the task in all meaningful relationships, not just romantic bonds.\" – Bell Hooks When news of our wedding made it into People, my phone started ringing off the hook. Friends from all over the world called, texted, and sent messages of love and congratulations. It was humbling to see our love story shared so publicly, but it also made me reflect on the journey that brought Liz and me to this moment. Marriage isn’t just about the wedding day; it’s about the love, work, and reflection that happen every day afterward. As I thought about our journey, I was reminded of a modern parable I once came across on social media—the Parable of the Two Mirrors. I’m unsure of the original author, but the story goes something like this: A man and woman were given two mirrors on their wedding day. They were told, \"These mirrors will show you the key to a happy 202 \fmarriage.\" Eager to unlock the wisdom, they looked into them—only to see their own reflections staring back. Disappointed, the husband said, \"This is just a normal mirror.\" The elder who gifted them the mirrors laughed and explained, \"Exactly. In marriage, you become a mirror to your partner. What you reflect—love, patience, understanding—is what you will receive in return. But if you reflect anger, resentment, or indifference, that too will come back to you. A happy marriage is built not just on love, but on the reflections, you choose to create every day.\" That story stuck with me because there are countless songs, scriptures, and pieces of wisdom reminding us of the importance of loving the person in the mirror. But marriage takes that lesson a step further: it asks us to reflect love even when we don’t feel it, to choose grace over frustration, and to offer patience when it’s needed most. Any married couple or long-term couple will attest that these things aren’t easy, but they definitely are doable. However, they take a tremendous amount of effort, at least for me they do. 203 \fAntoine de Saint-Exupéry, the author of The Little Prince, once wrote, \"Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction.\" That, to me, is what marriage is all about. It’s not just about staring into each other’s eyes in admiration, but about building a shared vision—aligning our hopes, dreams, and efforts to create something greater than ourselves. Every day with Liz reminds me that love is an active choice. It’s a reflection, a direction, and ultimately, a journey we take together. But that is only one version of love. Love like Liz and mine is often framed as romantic—a sweeping passion, a commitment to another person, a source of joy and, sometimes, heartache. But love is so much more than that. It is the energetic force that connects us to others, the anchor that grounds us in our relationships with family and friends, and the force that fuels our passions and purpose. At its core, love is relational—it shapes how we interact with the world, how we give, and how we receive. Most importantly, love includes the relationship we have 204 \fwith ourselves. Self-love is the foundation of all other love. It’s what enables us to show up authentically, to build meaningful connections, and to create a life that reflects our deepest values. Love, in all its forms, is the most powerful force we have—it heals, inspires, and transforms. As much as I loved Liz, I knew it was important that I fully love myself. Like the other prisons I escaped, getting out of the prison of feeling unlovable for most of my life, was a sacred and special journey that I am on to this day. The ride up the Pacific Coast Highway was nothing short of breathtaking. Waves crashed against the shore as swimmers and surfers dotted the expanse of beaches stretching from Santa Monica to Malibu. My destination: The Ranch Malibu. My car hugged the winding road, music thumping loudly, while the salty breeze flowed through my sunroof. The plan? Simple. Get my shit together. From the time I was released from prison I had been on the go. I had worn myself down—working late nights, running on fumes, sacrificing 205 \fsleep, and pushing my body past its limits. The weight crept on, the exhaustion became constant, but I kept moving, kept grinding. Like Mekhi Phifer’s character Mitch said in Paid in Full, \"I love the game. I love the hustle.\" And I did. The hustle drove me, fueled me, made me feel unstoppable. But it wasn’t just the hustle—it was the habits I had formed along the way. The lack of self-care, the missed doctors’ appointments, the pain I ignored because I convinced myself I didn’t have time to deal with it. Just like the prisons I’ve spoken about throughout this book, I was ensnared in the prison of grinding— believing that if I stopped, I’d lose everything I had built. In reality, though, I wasn’t just grinding. I was being ground down. As Anne Lamott put it: \"Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you.\" For the next seven days, I would hike, eat healthy, relax, and give up smoking the cheap cigars I had taken up fourteen or so years ago. Simple enough in theory, but I quickly realized this wasn’t some casual wellness getaway—it was the real deal. By the time I arrived on a cool, rainy December day, I’d already smoked my last 206 \fBlack & Mild on the drive up, a small but symbolic step into the commitment I’d made to myself. The place I had chosen wasn’t just a retreat—it felt like a world unto itself. Nestled in the mountains with lush gardens, a spa, heated pool and ice plunge the setting was serene, almost cinematic. The private cottages were understated yet luxurious, with reclaimed wood floors, limestone bathrooms, and linen-covered beds that felt as inviting as they looked. The intimacy of the experience, with only a small group of participants, created a unique environment for deep personal reflection and growth. By the second day, doubt crept in. Did I really need to be here? Was this rest even necessary? The pull of the hustle, my home, and my habits gnawed at me. I told myself I was wasting time—that I had shit to do, deals to close, people to connect with. Slowing down felt unnatural, almost like failure. I had spent so long in motion that stillness felt like a prison of its own.A part of me wanted to pack it in, head right back down the coast toward my home. But I reminded myself that resistance was part of the journey 207 \ftoward self-love. Each time doubt surfaced, it was an opportunity to dig deeper, to confront the parts of myself that weren’t ready to heal. Was this doubt I was feeling a kind of resistance—a battle between staying the same and allowing transformation to unfold? Why was I resisting a softer life and way of being? If I caved now, the possibilities waiting just beneath the surface would drown. The week was a mix of grueling rain drenched hikes, clean plant-based meals, daily massages and quiet moments of introspection. The structure of the program pushed me in ways I hadn’t been pushed since getting out of prison—physically, emotionally, and spiritually. By the final day, I felt lighter, clearer, more in tune with myself. My last hike was along the beach, the salty air filling my lungs as I reflected on the seven days of nourishing my body, mind, and spirit. I had done it. I had leaned into true self love. As I packed my duffle back and prepared to say my goodbyes to the people I had met, I was struck by a singular thought: for the first time in my adult life, I had treated my body with care, thoughtfulness and nourishment for an entire week. I had eaten clean food and not put 208 \fany impurities into my body. For most of my life pain, discomfort, and pushing my body to the limits by working through pain, eating crappy food and overindulgence was my norm. Treating myself with care was a new and challenging experience. I felt a sense of pride, that I had chosen myself for the first time in a long time. But as I got closer to the city, the tug of the familiar pulled hard. Before I knew it, I had pulled over at a gas station and grabbed a pack of Black & Milds. Sitting in the car, I lit the first one, taking a long, deep inhale of disappointment. What the fuck is wrong with me? I thought. Why can’t I stay on a course that ensures my health? The insistent cough I’d developed from smoking returned immediately. Damn! The seven days of work I had just poured into myself—all undone with a single puff. I felt myself spiraling. And then it hit me—grace. I owed myself grace. When it comes to true self-love, grace is one of the main ingredients. Instead of sinking so far down that I couldn’t pull myself back up, I decided to celebrate the fact that for seven days, I had fully loved myself. I made a vow to take it in chunks. For the next year, that’s exactly 209 \fwhat I would do—step by step, moment by moment. When I came up short, I wouldn’t beat myself up. I’d just get back to it. I gave up the idea that everything had to be perfect. Perfection, I realized, had been a barrier to freeing my body. What was most important for me was taking the steps forward no matter how many missteps I had along the way. To me, focusing on progress over perfection is not only one of the greatest unlocks in love, it’s also a key to unlocking the rest of life’s gifts. Digging Deeper For me, the journey toward understanding love began with the realization that I wasn’t showing up fully for myself. After a series of failed relationships, I had to take a hard look at what love really meant—what it meant to love myself enough to open up to someone else fully. And that journey took time; I had to confront the gaps in my own heart. I remember one day talking with a friend about relationships, dating apps, and the whole circus of meeting people online. We laughed at the absurdity of it all—the horror stories and the brief glimmers of 210 \fhope. But something she said stuck with me: “I just want someone who admires and respects me.” I suddenly realized that admiration and respect were things I hadn’t been prioritizing in my relationships. I had been focused on attraction, chemistry, and connection, but respect? Admiration? I hadn’t put those at the forefront, not because I didn’t value them, but because I hadn’t fully understood how much they mattered. That moment forced me to reflect, to step away from dating, from the casual hookups, and ask myself, “What does love look like when I truly love myself?” It was in this space of self-reflection that I started to understand what I was really looking for in a partner. I wasn’t just looking for a romantic connection—I was searching for something deeper, someone who saw me, admired me, and respected me for who I was, and I had to offer the same in return. I began to understand that love is about showing up in all the small moments, especially with my son, Sekou. One story that stands out vividly in my memory is from 2016, during the NBA Finals. Ben called me up with courtside tickets to 211 \fGame 7—the Cleveland Cavaliers vs. the Golden State Warriors. LeBron James was about to make history, and I had the chance to witness it firsthand. It was the kind of opportunity you don’t say no to. But there was one catch: it was Father’s Day. I had promised Sekou I’d be home to spend the day with him. He was only four and a half years old at the time, and he wouldn’t have known the difference between Sunday or Monday. But in my mind, breaking that promise felt like a betrayal. I wrestled with the decision; torn between the once-in-a-lifetime experience and the commitment I’d made to my son. I was in LA and only a forty-fiveminute flight and a Lyft ride away from the stadium. Ultimately, I decided to fly home. We spent the day laughing, playing, and creating our own little memories. When Game 7 finally aired, I watched it at a local bar with friends. We had a great time, but a part of me was sick to my stomach that I had missed the opportunity to see Lebron, Kyrie, Steph and Draymond in person at the same time. 212 \fThe game itself was legendary. The Cavaliers, down 3-1 in the series, had battled back to force this decisive Game 7. No team in NBA Finals history had ever come back from such a deficit to win the championship, but LeBron James was determined to rewrite that narrative. From the bar, I watched the drama unfold while Sekou was at home in bed. LeBron’s chase-down block on Andre Iguodala, Kyrie Irving’s clutch three-pointer, and the Cavaliers' nail-biting 93-89 victory became stories I could tell Sekou over and over as he grew older, as I reminded him of how much I sacrificed for him, like any good dad would do. LeBron’s triple-double—27 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists—cemented his Finals MVP status and his legacy. But for me, the real story wasn’t just about the game. It was about the choice I made that day to prioritize fatherhood over fandom. . The ambivalence pulled at me—not just in the moment, but long after. Was the right thing to go to the game or be with Sekou? I told myself that showing up, being present, was what mattered most. But for who? Him? Me? The guilt of choosing one over the 213 \fother conflicted with my sense of duty. I had spent years as a father making decisions based on good values—responsibility, sacrifice, commitment. But what happens when those values come into conflict with joy, authenticity, or even self-care? This, too, was a prison-a well-intentioned one. It’s one of the hidden prisons we all face as parents, spouses, leaders, and in our struggle to love ourselves. The weight of expectation, of always doing the right thing, can keep us from doing the thing that makes us feel alive, fills us with joy or allow us to take care of ourselves. We tell ourselves it’s noble, that it’s what’s required, but sometimes it’s just another way we trap ourselves—mistaking obligation for love, duty for purpose. Sekou likely won’t remember any details of that day, and I will always think back to that game and wonder what that experience was like in person. LeBron made history that night, but for me, it was a reminder that the most important choices and lessons happen off the court. And most of the time they come from the people we love. 214 \fIn hindsight, I realize that decision came more from a place of guilt and fear than from love. I feared that if I didn’t keep my word, I’d be failing as a father. The truth is, love isn’t about making perfect decisions—it’s about being present and showing up, even with all your imperfections. Sekou wouldn’t have minded if I stayed an extra day, but I had placed an immense amount of pressure on myself to be the “perfect” dad in that moment, trying to live up to an ideal that didn’t truly matter to him, It’s a lesson I had to learn—love isn’t about getting it right all the time. It’s about being there, in whatever form that takes, and knowing that sometimes, love means letting yourself off the hook. Love is complex and ever-changing. It’s not something you “figure out” once and have all the answers—it’s a continuous journey. Whether with your spouse, your children, or even in your work, love demands patience, presence, and the grace to fail without fear. True strength in any relationship—personal or professional— comes from creating a safe space where growth, mistakes, and learning are not only allowed but embraced. Love isn’t about 215 \fperfection; it’s about showing up, being present, and committing to the process My mother used to say, “Close the door! I’m not trying to heat the whole neighborhood!” when we’d leave the door open during Detroit winters. As a kid, I didn’t fully understand that my mother was basically saying you must keep something inside for yourself. But now, I see it as a metaphor for being intentional about the love and energy we share, not just with others, but with ourselves. If we leave the doors of our hearts and spirits wide open, without boundaries, we risk losing our warmth. Love requires that we conserve some of that warmth for ourselves so we can show up fully for others. As the saying goes, you can’t pour from an empty cup. To truly love others, you must love yourself enough to protect your energy, to replenish your soul. This lesson applies to more than just personal relationships— it’s the same in business. When you show up in love—in love for your purpose, in love for the people you work with, and in love for the work itself—everything changes. Your colleagues, your 216 \fcustomers, your team—they all feel that energy. Sure, you’ll encounter curmudgeons and sourpusses along the way—people who run businesses on talent alone, without love—but the ultimate leaders, the ones who build something lasting, are those who lead with love or, at the very least, don’t stand in the way of those who do. Leading with love in business, in family, and in life doesn’t mean being soft. Love has the power to transform every aspect of our lives, including the way we work. You can love your work, be passionate about your mission, and even care deeply for the people you collaborate with. That love can inspire you to lead with empathy, build trust, and create an environment where others feel seen and valued. But let’s not confuse the love of work with the love we share with our family, friends, or even ourselves. Work, no matter how much we care about it, is still work. It requires boundaries to ensure it remains a part of your life, not the entirety of it. We often see people invest so much emotional energy into their jobs that they lose sight of the distinction between professional 217 \fcommitment and personal connection. Fans get upset when athletes switch teams, and employees feel betrayed when colleagues leave for a competitor. But the truth is, loving the work doesn’t mean staying in one place forever. Sometimes, for work or a career to thrive, it needs a new environment. Loving what you do doesn’t mean sacrificing your growth or happiness—it means having the wisdom to make choices that align with your purpose. However, that wisdom doesn’t come without pain. When it was time for me to leave Navan, I knew I would miss the people I worked alongside of. We had built something special, had personal relationships. I would also miss going to the office, meeting new customers and seeing the innovation in real time. Yet it was the right decision for me, and more importantly it was the right decision for the company. As a leader, love is one of the most powerful tools you can bring to the table. When you show up with love, you lead with compassion, build stronger relationships, and inspire others to do their best work. But love in leadership also means knowing when to 218 \fstep back, when to set healthy boundaries, and when to make tough decisions for the greater good. Boundaries are essential—not just for protecting your well-being, but for preserving the integrity of your work and your relationships. Love in the workplace is not about blurring lines—it’s about showing up with authenticity, bringing your whole self to the table, and recognizing that work, while meaningful, is not the entirety of who you are. It’s about creating a culture of trust and collaboration while keeping the balance that allows you to nurture other parts of your life. When you lead with love and maintain boundaries, you not only elevate the work itself—you create space for everyone involved to grow and thrive, including yourself. It means being strong enough to show up authentically, to create spaces where people can thrive, and to make decisions from a place of respect and admiration. It means knowing that love is the foundation for everything else—whether you’re on a Zoom call with your future spouse, keeping a promise to your son, or sitting court side at the game of life. 219 \fReflecting on these truths, I began to see patterns emerge—key lessons that not only shaped my relationship with Liz but also redefined how I approached love in all its forms. These lessons aren’t confined to romantic relationships; they apply to friendships, family, and the relationship we have with ourselves. Here are the key lessons I’ve learned, along with actionable steps that can help us all deepen our capacity to give and receive love. Digging deeper 1. Love is a Reflection: In relationships, what you project—whether it’s love, patience, understanding, or resentment—will often be reflected back to you. If you want kindness and love, reflect those qualities yourself. Healthy relationships are a mirror of our best intentions. 2. Love is a Shared Vision: True love isn’t just about emotional connection; it’s about aligning your goals, values, and efforts to create something 220 \fbigger than yourselves. Partners thrive when they look outward together and work toward a common purpose. 3. Self-Love is Foundational: Self-love is the cornerstone of all other forms of love. Without it, we cannot show up fully in relationships, pursue our passions, or sustain meaningful connections. Loving yourself first creates the space to love others authentically. 4. Love is Imperfect but Continuous: Love isn’t about getting it right all the time. It’s about showing up consistently, embracing the messiness of relationships, and granting yourself and others grace when things don’t go as planned. Keys to leading with love 1. Daily Reflection Exercise: Take five minutes each evening to reflect on your interactions throughout the day. Ask yourself: o “What energy did I bring to my relationships today?” 221 \fo “Did I reflect the love, patience, and understanding I hope to receive?” If the answer is no, visualize how you’ll adjust tomorrow. Over time, this practice creates mindfulness in your relationships and helps cultivate intentionality. 2. Create and Revisit a Shared Vision: Schedule a “vision talk” with your partner or loved one. Spend time discussing your goals, values, and dreams. Write them down and revisit them regularly. For example: o Plan a monthly check-in to evaluate how you’re working toward shared goals. o Celebrate milestones together, no matter how small. This exercise keeps both of you aligned and strengthens the bond through collaboration. 3. Practice Self-Love Consistently: Dedicate intentional time to nurture yourself mentally, emotionally, and physically. Examples include: 222 \fo Morning Affirmations: Start the day by saying three things you love about yourself. o Self-Care Routine: Choose one self-nurturing activity weekly, whether it’s yoga, a long walk, or reading a book. o Forgive Yourself: When you fall short, replace selfcriticism with compassion. Remind yourself that progress, not perfection, is the goal. Building self-love helps you show up as your best self in every relationship. 4. Celebrate Progress Over Perfection: Keep a journal or notebook to track moments when you make progress in love—whether it’s resolving a conflict calmly, setting boundaries, or showing extra patience. Celebrate these moments with a tangible action: o Treat yourself to something small but meaningful, like a favorite coffee or time to relax. o Share your wins with someone you trust, acknowledging the effort it takes to grow in love. 223 \fBy shifting the focus to progress, you’ll create a mindset that encourages persistence and resilience. These aren’t just lessons; they are keys to unlocking the deepest parts of yourself—your capacity to love, to reflect, to grow, and to show up fully in your relationships, parenting and work. They guide you toward self-discovery, teaching you that love isn’t just something you give, but something you cultivate within, shaping every connection in your life romantically and professionally. 224 \fChapter Nine Joy \"Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray.\" – Rumi Joy is a powerful force—it can pierce through even the darkest circumstances, offering light in places where it feels impossible to find any. Viktor Frankl wrote about this in Man’s Search for Meaning, describing how, even in the unimaginable suffering of Nazi concentration camps, joy could be found in the smallest moments: a sunrise, a shared joke, or the memory of a loved one. For Frankl, joy wasn’t about denying pain but finding something within to keep going. I’ve experienced that truth firsthand. One day, a few months before I started working in the recreation center at the prison, I found Tom’s wallet on the floor outside the office. It was stuffed with cash, his driver’s license, and everything he needed to navigate his job in an environment where losing that ID could have gotten him suspended or even put the prison on lockdown. Without hesitation, I 225 \fwalked the wallet over to Tom and handed it back. His face lit up with gratitude as he thanked me repeatedly, but at the time, I didn’t think much of it. I wasn’t a thief, and returning it was simply the right thing to do. What I didn’t realize until later was how much joy Tom brought to that environment. He wasn’t just the recreation supervisor—he was a lifeline. Tom greeted everyone with a smile, cracked jokes that could lift even the heaviest spirits, and made sure we had everything we needed to keep the sports programs running. He went above and beyond to create moments of levity and goodness in a place where those things were rare. I’ll never forget the first Christmas I worked for him. He brought in pizza and homemade cookies, a simple gesture that felt monumental in an environment like that. He even gave me a card to sign for my oldest son Jay and later slipped some money inside. Tom believed that joy wasn’t just a luxury—it was a necessity. It wasn’t until years later that I realized the depth of his lesson. Joy 226 \fisn’t something you wait for—it’s something you choose to share, even in the hardest circumstances. Like Frankl’s sunrise or Campbell who said, \"Find a place inside where there's joy, and the joy will burn out the pain.\" This call to look inward, and Tom’s kindness reminded me that even in the bleakest places, joy can burn away the pain. For many years, I found myself locked in a tug-of-war between fully experiencing joy and tempering my feelings against the backdrop of my past. Coming out of prison, I carried a constant tension—a push and pull between gratitude for the life I now had and the guilt that came with having survived when so many hadn’t. This tension wasn’t just mental; it ran through me emotionally, spiritually, and physically. It’s a weight many survivors of trauma, violence, and incarceration know too well. One of the harshest realities of surviving trauma is the guilt that follows. It’s not the kind of guilt that fades with time. It’s deeper— more insidious. It’s what Dr. William G. Niederland famously referred to as survivor's guilt in his work on Holocaust survivors—a feeling of 227 \fundeserved survival, as though the fact that I was alive and free meant I owed something to those who weren’t so lucky. For years, I carried that weight like a lumberjack shouldering logs, dragging it through moments of triumph, through every celebration. It was hard to stand fully in my own light, haunted by the shadows of those I had left behind. It took me time to realize that the only way to experience joy fully was to accept that I deserved it, that I had a right to my own happiness and success. This became apparent after my book Writing My Wrongs became a bestseller. I was invited to all kinds of experiences from Oscar and Grammy parties to celebrity-filled dinners in my honor. But even still there was that constant nagging inside that didn’t always allow me to be present in the joy of the experience. In August of 2023, Liz and I received an invitation to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Italy. The call was simple: “Get to Rome, and we’ll take care of the rest.” Over the weeks leading up to the trip, I caught glimpses of what was in store—luxury accommodations, a mega yacht, a five-star chef, and stops along 228 \fthe Amalfi Coast and Pompeii. It sounded like a dream and a trip of a lifetime. And yet, as excited as I was, something kept me from embracing it fully. I felt disoriented, unable to put both feet firmly in the moment. Why couldn’t I simply enjoy the trip? The answer, I realized, lay in the survivor’s guilt I had carried for so long. I had survived the trauma of childhood, gun violence, and prison. I had made it out, while so many others hadn’t. Every time I experienced something good—something joyous—I felt like I was betraying those who were still suffering. I had to remind myself that joy wasn’t something I needed to justify. And that’s what survivors often fail to realize. We tend to believe that the pain, guilt, and shame won’t end, and that love, joy, and success aren’t meant for us. This belief is often rooted in ego and in a scarcity mindset. Ego tells us that we are defined by our mistakes, our failures, and the worst moments of our lives. It clings to these narratives as if letting them go would strip us of our identity. Meanwhile, a scarcity mindset whispers that there isn’t enough love or joy to go around: if you grab 229 \fa bit, you’re denying someone else. Others deserve it more, and you’re unworthy. Together, ego and scarcity reinforce the walls of our internal prisons, convincing us that healing and abundance are out of reach. Yet, the truth is, abundance flows when we release the need to hold onto what no longer serves us and allow ourselves to embrace the possibilities beyond our pain. I meditated to liberate myself from that nagging feeling and leaned into the trip. And what a trip it was, every moment, every conversation, every meal, every day there was magic, love, revelation and more joy than I ever knew existed. I chose joy and joy chose me. We rode jet skis, vibed out in the hot tub on the back of the yacht, bounced from island to island, shopped in Capri and even witnessed a volcano exploding. If I had let that voice from the past take over, I would have missed out on the chance to experience the highest level of joy possible. Eckhart Tolle’s The Power of Now became the inspiration for a mantra I used to support this shift: “You have the power right now to decide your experience. You have the power to accept this 230 \fincredible gift. And you have the power to enjoy the shit out of it without feeling guilty for it!” It’s about living fully in the “right now” moments. When I embraced that, everything began to shift. I understood that joy didn’t erase my past, but it allowed me to live beyond it. Experiencing joy meant I could finally live the life I had envisioned for myself and my family, free from the chains of my history. I have to admit I still struggle with learning how to embrace joy, whether in the grand, picture-perfect moments, or in the cracks, in the everyday. But now I find that watering my plants watching my wife and son light up with excitement brings me joy. I realized that joy is a practice—something you nurture, like a garden. One day, while scrolling through Instagram, looking for a recipe, I stumbled upon a viral video of a teacher and her students performing the “Thriller” choreography in perfect sync. There was something so pure about it—the joy on their faces, the way they moved together, free and uninhibited. I craved to have that kind of experience of unbridled joy. That freedom to just be. Witnessing joy 231 \flike that always stirs something deep inside me. It reminds me of how much I had denied myself those feelings, how much I had distanced myself from experiencing life’s fullness. Growing up in a tough environment, where masculinity was equated with stoicism and toughness, created barriers I didn’t even realize were there. I was taught not to feel, not to cry, not to emote— not because of philosophy, but because of survival. In a world shaped by trauma, gun violence, and PTSD, emotions were a liability, and vulnerability could get you hurt. It was an extreme form of stoicism, not the kind preached in boardrooms or self-help books, but the kind that kept you alive. We weren’t mastering our emotions to build resilience in business—we were shutting them down to avoid becoming a target. Social norms told me that vulnerability was weakness, that showing joy or softness made me less of a man. These unspoken rules conditioned me to suppress emotions, to see happiness as fleeting or undeserved. Over time, I built walls so high around my heart that even when joy knocked, I couldn’t let it in. But moments like the ones that played out in the video—when joy is 232 \fundeniable—remind me that breaking down those barriers is where true freedom begins. Shortly after I was released from prison, I was invited to Big Bear Lake, California, to speak at an event called Unique Camp, hosted by a woman named Sonja who is now a dear friend. My two younger sisters, Nakia and Shamica, along with my friend Calvin, flew from Detroit to LA to join me. The following day, we piled onto a bus with a lively group of campers and wound our way up the mountains to Big Bear Lake. What I encountered over the next few days was so far removed from the streets I had come home to, and the prison I had left behind. People danced like no one was watching, laughed freely, and radiated an effortless peace. They smiled as if unburdened by the weight of the world. Even my sisters, who weren’t exactly known for stepping outside their comfort zones, were celebrated for diving into the activities, making new friends, and dancing on tables like they had been born for it. Watching them embrace the moment was beautiful, but it also stirred something in me. I realized how much I 233 \fwanted that joy for myself but had never allowed it. I had become so accustomed to denying myself happiness that even witnessing it in others felt foreign. Over time, I began leaning in. One night, I climbed a hill and marveled at the stars, amazed at how close the moon seemed up there in the mountains. The last morning, I even agreed to join the group for the polar bear plunge. As I got ready to leave my cabin, stripped down to just a towel, my roommate stopped me in my tracks, laughing hysterically. I had misunderstood the concept of the plunge and thought it meant going in completely naked. Embarrassed but amused, I hurried back to grab some shorts before joining everyone at the pool. The plunge was freezing, but it left me invigorated, alive, and, most importantly, laughing with a group of people who had embraced me as one of their own. That weekend in Big Bear wasn’t just a trip; it was a turning point. It was the first time I allowed myself to feel the fullness of life again—to let joy, laughter, and connection break through the walls I had built. It reminded me that the barriers I thought were protecting 234 \fme were actually keeping me from the things I needed most. Joy, as I learned that weekend, isn’t something you wait for; it’s something you step into, even if it feels unfamiliar at first. I also began to understand something important: I’d often avoided joy out of fear. Afraid that if I let myself feel it, it would be taken away. But the truth is, by avoiding joy, I’d missed much deeper connections - deep love, the freedom to dance, and the ability to just be myself in relationships. I had to drop my guard, learn to be vulnerable in conversations and in moments of pure celebration without shrinking in shame or guilt. These days, you might find me wandering through used bookstores, hunting for first-edition treasures or unlocking the forgotten boxes of life’s little joys like driving with my music blasting and saying yes to more adventure. I’m breaking free from the ruts of the day-to-day, leaning into the simple, unfiltered joy of children, and reintroducing play into my life—not as something scheduled or structured, but as an organic way to rediscover happiness. Play isn’t another job on the to-do list; it’s a state of being. 235 \fI wouldn’t call myself an enthusiast just yet, but I’m getting there. Whether it’s spinning records, hiking with my family, or working out with my son, I’m finding more ways to embrace joy. It’s not about perfection; it’s about presence. And with each small moment, I’m learning to savor life just a little more. Healing, I’ve learned, isn’t a one-time event. It’s not a moment of clarity that suddenly fixes everything. My soul was battered for decades, and healing those wounds didn’t come from a few therapy sessions or reading a self-help book. It took years of digging deep and clawing my way back to the surface. My spirit was torn apart by a fractured home, the griminess of the streets and incarceration. My body was torn apart by bullets, beatings and bars. My heart was torn apart by the loss of my brother and our puppy. And I’ve had to work to stitch the pieces of myself back together over and over again. Finding or reclaiming joy was integral to that stitching. There are days when I still feel the weight of past trauma trying to insert itself into my current life. On most days, I can find joy in the things I truly love, like great music, time spent with family or a great 236 \fbook. But on other days, the past pokes at me, reminding me of where I’ve been. Living in joy has required me to be present in the fullest way possible, to acknowledge that I am worthy of all the good life has to offer. Today, I find joy more easily because I look for it in the everyday. But its not just me, people all over are searching for joy and meaning. Sometimes it's getting away from a brutal news cycle, breaking away from doom scrolling or just enjoying life. The more I search for joy the more things I discover along the way. Digging deeper: A journey beyond the surface For much of my life, joy seemed like a fleeting sensation—tied to moments of success, immediate gratification, or the temporary highs of accomplishment. But as I delved deeper into my personal journey, I realized that true joy required me to go beyond the surface. It wasn’t just about what felt good in the moment but about how my choices resonated holistically with my values, my long-term vision, and the life I wanted to build. 237 \fAs a writer and speaker, I knew my work would impact others. I understood that my words and stories could inspire change, spark conversations, and help people transform their lives. But I also knew that passion alone wouldn’t sustain me—or my family—financially. While mentoring and advocating for others brought me immense fulfillment, it also came with moments of heaviness, where the emotional toll felt almost unbearable. I had to figure out how to navigate this dynamic—how to sustain my work without depleting myself. Through this process, I realized that joy is more than just fleeting moments of fun; it is the result of aligning passion with purpose. It’s what I now call moving from fun to fulfillment. It’s about finding joy in my purpose and allowing that joy to sustain me, even when life feels heavy. But this isn’t just about me. The question is: Where do you find joy? Maybe you’re already leaning into it, or maybe you’re still searching for that connection. Either way, it’s worth asking yourself: • Does your work bring you joy? 238 \f• Are you passionate about it? • Does it align with your values and long-term vision? • Can you sustain yourself and the life you want while doing it? If the answers aren’t clear, that’s okay. What matters is taking the time to reflect and allowing yourself to discover joy—not just the fleeting kind, but the kind that fills your life with purpose and meaning. The Wisdom of Ikigai and Gross National Happiness During this journey, I came across two powerful philosophies that reshaped my understanding of joy: Ikigai from Japan and Gross National Happiness (GNH) from Bhutan. These frameworks gave me tools to think more deeply about purpose, alignment, and the role of joy in our lives. Ikigai, a concept that originated in Okinawa, Japan, is loosely translated as \"a reason for being.\" It dates back to the Heian period (794–1185) and has been a guiding principle in Japanese culture for 239 \fcenturies. The idea of Ikigai encourages individuals to find the intersection of four elements: 1. What you love (your passion) 2. What you’re good at (your skills) 3. What the world needs (your mission) 4. What you can be paid for (your profession) When these four elements align, you discover your Ikigai—a life of purpose and fulfillment. Okinawa, a place known for its high concentration of centenarians, is often cited as an example of Ikigai in action. Research suggests that the practice of Ikigai contributes to longevity and well-being by giving people a clear sense of purpose. Roughly three thousand miles to the west of Japan, Bhutan introduced the world to Gross National Happiness (GNH) in 1972 the year I was born. King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the fourth king of Bhutan, coined the term to measure the nation’s progress beyond the narrow confines of economic growth. Instead of GDP, Bhutan assesses its success by how well it fosters the happiness and wellbeing of its citizens. 240 \fThe GNH framework is built on four pillars: 1. Sustainable and equitable socio-economic development 2. Preservation and promotion of culture 3. Conservation of the environment 4. Good governance These pillars are then broken down into nine domains, ranging from psychological well-being to ecological diversity. Bhutan’s commitment to GNH has made it a global leader in redefining progress and has inspired countries, researchers, and organizations to rethink the way they measure success. Becoming Your Own Joy Hunter These philosophies helped me understand that joy isn’t just about personal happiness—it’s about alignment, balance, and connection to something greater than ourselves. But how do you take these ideas and make them actionable? 241 \fStart by becoming your own Joy Hunter. Actively seek out joy in your life, not as a passive byproduct but as something you cultivate intentionally. Here are some steps to guide you: 1. Remember the last time you leaned into a joyful moment. When was the last time you felt pure joy? What were you doing, and who were you with? Use that as a starting point to create more of those experiences. 2. Make joy part of your budget.Whether it’s financial, emotional, or time-based, invest in joy like you would any other necessity. Treat yourself to a hobby, plan a trip, or set aside time for something you love. 3. Reconnect with childhood joy. What did you love to do as a kid? Buy a coloring book, do a puzzle, play a game, or go outside and explore. Let yourself be playful and curious. 4. Find other Joy Hunters. Surround yourself with people who value joy and encourage you to pursue it. Whether it’s through a hiking group, a creative class, or a weekly meetup, joy is amplified when shared. 242 \f5. Do something new or unexpected. Challenge yourself to step outside your routine. Try a new recipe, take a pottery class, or spend an afternoon exploring your local area with fresh eyes. 6. Spend time in nature. Bhutan’s focus on environmental conservation reminded me of the healing power of nature. Go for a hike, take a walk, or sit outside and soak in the beauty around you. The Power of Choosing Joy Choosing joy isn’t just about feeling good—it’s about living fully. It’s about aligning your passions and purpose, fostering deep connections, and creating a life that feels vibrant and meaningful. When you embrace joy, you don’t just live—you thrive. So ask yourself: What’s in it for me when I choose joy? The answer is simple: everything. Joy fuels you, connects you, and makes life worth living. And when you start seeking it intentionally, 243 \fyou’ll discover that the journey of being a Joy Hunter is just as fulfilling as the joy itself. 244 \fChapter Ten Success \"I attribute my success to this: I never gave or took any excuse.\" – Florence Nightingale We often look at the lives of people we believe have \"made it,\" without realizing that what we’re seeing is the finished product. The polished success story often hides the countless hours of effort, sacrifice, and learning it took to get there. What I’ve come to understand through observation and conversations with people who have been successful in business, sports, marriage, and life is this: success is always a process. For some, it meant staying late at the office or gym, waking up an hour earlier, reading that extra book, seeking out a mentor or coach, and consistently going above and beyond what was required or expected. When I connect the dots across those conversations 245 \fand analyze the outcomes, my friend Ben’s words resonate deeply: “Success is about making one smart decision after another, and most of those decisions depend on the mindset you bring to the table.” But Ben also reminded me of an equally important truth: failure works the same way. It’s often the result of one poor decision after another. He asked me questions that forced me to reflect on my own failures: Did you overlook something you should have noticed? Did you ignore key details that might have changed the outcome? Did you fail to care enough to follow through? What I realized is that failure isn’t a single catastrophic event. More often, it’s the result of small missteps that compound over time. But those missteps, while painful, are also the greatest teachers. Every failure contains lessons about what to do differently, where to pay closer attention, and how to adapt. 246 \fRecently, I saw a video of a lion sitting under a tree. It looked as though the lion had sought out the tree for shade from the relentless sun. While it sat there, something unbelievable happened—an impala fell from the tree, almost like manna from the sky. The lion stared at the impala in what seemed like utter disbelief, as if it couldn’t comprehend its luck. And why would it? Lions don’t sit under trees waiting for food to drop from the sky. In their nature, lions hunt—they stalk, they chase, they work for their meals. It’s the same with success. Yes, every now and then, someone will get the luckiest break and have their version of an impala fall from the sky. But for the rest of us, like a lion living in its nature, we have to go out and hunt for success. We have to take deliberate steps, fail, learn, and try again—because success isn’t an accident, and it certainly isn’t guaranteed. What I’ve learned is that the road to success and the road to failure often look remarkably similar at first. Success is built on a foundation of small, intentional actions taken consistently over time. It requires attention to detail, persistence, and a willingness to learn 247 \ffrom every setback. Failure, on the other hand, often stems from neglecting those same principles. When I think about the stories of those I admire most, they all followed this universal truth: success is earned. It’s not about luck or waiting for your opportunity to fall into your lap—it’s about staying committed to the process. So when you think about the freedom of success, I encourage you to ask yourself: Are you taking one smart step after the next, or are you sitting under the tree, waiting for success to fall into your lap? The ownership of success lies in your choices, your actions, and your willingness to go out and hunt for it. To reach success-you have to own it! And remember, even if you stumble or fail, each misstep is just another opportunity to learn, grow, and get closer to your goal. The Inner Battle Success, to me, has always been a battle fought on the inside. It’s a relentless duel between the voices of my past—those broken, 248 \fcynical echoes—and my authentic voice that knows I can harness the power of the universe for good, including my own greater good. I realized early on while journaling in solitary that the key to success was in feeding the right voice, starving the wrong one. This is the essence of mentally writing my wrongs. The negative voice doesn’t just disappear; it lurks in the background, waiting for a chance to surface. It’s there every time you say you’re triggered, reminding you of its presence. But by acknowledging it, I’ve learned to control it. Writing My Way Out: The Power of Words When I first heard \"I Wrote My Way Out\" by Aloe Blacc, it felt like the universe was speaking directly to me. Indeed, I had written my way out of prison and up into a position where I could help others. My escape wasn’t just from the physical confines of incarceration; it was a mental and emotional liberation through the power of ink and paper. For years I journaled, made notes in the books and articles I had read, from authors who had overcome the odds, escaped their 249 \fown hidden prisons and found success despite the odds they had faced. I crafted a new escape plan—one built on three pillars: Ideation, Activation, and Manifestation. I spent hours imagining my new life, down to the smallest details like the car I would drive and the family dynamics I desired. Next came activation, taking immediate steps to turn my dreams into reality. Finally, through consistent action, I manifested the life I had envisioned. Step by Step I was getting my S.H.I.T together. Own Your S.H.I.T.: A Blueprint for Success Owning my S.H.I.T. has been a guiding principle for my success. It’s a reminder to take full responsibility for my journey, broken down as follows: • Success: Only I can define what success looks like for me, whether as a partner, employee, or entrepreneur. While others can contribute to my success, it’s ultimately my responsibility to chart the course. 250 \f• Hustle: The drive to pursue my ambitions comes from within. Yes, others can inspire or push me, but I am the one who must get up and go after my goals. • Intelligence: I am the architect of my mind, responsible for feeding it the knowledge and skills needed to succeed. Recommendations from others are valuable, but it’s up to me to apply them. • Talent: We all have innate talents, but without practice and dedication, they go to waste. Honoring my gifts means continually challenging myself to grow. Redefining Success Joining Navan in 2020, as Head of DEI, was a transformative step in my career, which allowed me to bring my social impact experience into a corporate setting. My journey with Navan took me from Head of DEI to Head of Sales and Success Culture, and ultimately to VP of Corporate Communications. I found myself working alongside sales leaders, learning and growing with each step, misstep, success and failure. 251 \fOne of the most surreal moments was being invited to the New York Stock Exchange. Standing on that historic floor, I was reminded of the incredible distance I’d traveled—from the mean streets of Detroit and solitary confinement to the heights of corporate America. Navan’s commitment to creating a people-first workplace resonated deeply with me. The importance we placed on workplace experience, from food, to pets, to fun, to encouraging our employees to travel and experience the world. The environment was encouraging and inspiring even when it was tough, and I was proud to represent a company that truly valued success not just as a business metric, but as a human experience. Digging Deeper Not every project was a success. I took on roles that weren’t the right fit, shouldered more responsibility than was wise, and often failed to ask the right questions up front. There was no logical reason for me to leave my role as Head of Sales and Success Culture. I loved that job. I thrived in it—training our staff to become incredible 252 \fstorytellers, helping young reps and account executives sharpen their craft. They were true hustlers, and there was nothing more exhilarating than hustling alongside go-getters. But I got caught up in the allure of growth. The VP of Corporate Communications role seemed like an opportunity to step outside my comfort zone, to stretch myself in new ways. I didn’t ask the right questions. If I had, I would have realized that the thrill of pitching our product at SXSW, hosting tech execs at company parties, and scoring front-row tickets to music venues would be replaced by drafting customer emails every time a travel crisis hit. Had I known, there’s no way I would have taken that role. I would rather have watched paint dry. Reflecting on that experience taught me the importance of pausing, assessing, and ensuring that the roles and projects I took on were truly aligned with my skills and values. I promised myself that I would never take on a job title or agree to work on a project that snuffed out my imagination. 253 \fAfter launching the rebrand at Navan in my role as VP of Corporate Comms, I knew it was time for me to move on from corporate America as an employee and focus on my creativity and the investment opportunities that had come as a result of my work in Silicon Valley over the years. It was a risky leap, but I felt prepared for it. Master Your Thinking, Master Your Destiny Success isn’t an end point; it’s a continuous journey that requires mastery over one’s own thoughts and actions. It’s about taking the tools of survival and transforming them into instruments of success. The hard-earned lessons, the unique experience of going through hardship and thriving in spite of it, while using what you know to get you where you are trying to go. It’s about rejecting excuses and fully embracing the responsibility for your own path. What helped me was that I had a greater fear of stagnation than of failure. It felt scarier to remain in place than to step into the unknown and move toward my larger goals. So, stop emptying your tank for everyone else and start fueling your own journey. 254 \fReflecting on my journey, from prison to becoming a New York Times bestselling author, a TED speaker, an MIT Media Lab Fellow, and being featured in documentaries like Emmy-Award-winning The 13th directed by Ava Duvernay, I realize that success didn’t come in a straight line. It wasn’t about one big win—it was about consistently showing up, day after day, with discipline, focus, and an unwavering belief in my own potential. It was about being creative, wild with my imagination and pushing past the boundaries society set for me. It was also about having the guts to walk away when things no longer served me, or simply for a new adventure. That belief was fueled by stories of others who had dared to dream big, like Richard Williams, the father of Venus and Serena Williams. He saw greatness in his daughters long before the world did, and his belief, combined with their relentless discipline, incredible talent and sheer determination, changed the world of tennis. Or Tom Brady, the underdog drafted 199th overall who went on to become a seven-time Super Bowl champion. These examples 255 \fremind me that success is built on more than talent—it's about foresight, discipline, and an unshakeable commitment to your vision. People often focus on the end result—on the shiny surface of success. But success is built in the grind. It’s in the extra hours spent refining your craft, in the late-night brainstorms, in the resilience you build when things don’t go as planned. Success is a practice—it’s not a one-time achievement or an end goal. It’s the willingness to keep going when things get tough, to adapt and adjust your course when challenges arise, and to believe that the best is still ahead of you. Success is about staying open to the possibilities, recognizing that there is so much more to experience and explore. The accomplishments I’m most proud of weren’t the result of luck or even pure talent. I’ve been in dark places—feeling hopeless, lost, depressed, and drowning in anger. There were moments when the weight of my circumstances felt insurmountable, when the path forward seemed invisible, and the darkness seemed to stretch endlessly. But success wasn’t about some magical turning point or 256 \fan overnight transformation. It was built slowly, steadily—brick by brick. One of the most transformative lessons I’ve embraced is the value of doing the hard things first. Facing the difficult conversations, tackling the challenges I wanted to avoid, and embracing discomfort head-on. I had to have hard conversations with myself when I left my Executive Director position at the Anti Recidivism Coalition and again when I left my role at Navan. Did I have enough money to get by while I got clients, booked speaking engagements and worked on deals to pay me? Did I have the support I needed to make such a bold leap? Was my decision going to have a negative impact on Sekou’s quality of life? I had to curb my spending, balance my budget differently and contract my lifestyle where needed. I had to invest my money in things that may or may not return anything, and turn down guaranteed money, when it didn’t align with my vision. It wasn’t easy—it required grit, courage, and belief in the possibility of something better. But the more I leaned into the hard things, the 257 \flighter life became. Each obstacle I overcame added strength to my spirit and clarity to my vision. When people look at my life or the lives of others, they often see the highlight reels, but miss all of the seconds, minutes and hours of hard work and the many years of doubt and instability. Being featured on Nas’s Grammy-nominated album wasn’t just a moment of serendipity—it was the culmination of years of building relationships, of honing my voice as a writer, and of having the courage to step into spaces where I wasn’t always comfortable. Digging Deeper Success is layered. It’s not just financial or professional—it’s emotional, mental, and spiritual. It’s about alignment—about creating a life that not only supports your dreams but elevates the people around you. That’s the lesson I’ve learned: success isn’t about titles or accolades; it’s about living in harmony with your purpose and making sure that every step you take is a step toward your highest potential. 258 \fThe journey isn’t over. Every day is an opportunity to grow, to build, to redefine what success looks like. It’s about continuously betting on yourself, pivoting when necessary, and never losing sight of the vision that set you on this path in the first place. I’m evolving and looking to go on the next adventure and look forward to meeting you along the way. Recognizing the building blocks of success 1. Success Is a Process, Not an Event Success isn’t something that happens overnight. It’s built through consistent, small actions, discipline, and learning from failure. The highlight reel of someone’s life doesn’t show the long nights, hard choices, and relentless pursuit of improvement. 2. Failure Is a Teacher, Not a Life Sentence Every failure carries valuable lessons—overlooked details, ignored warnings, or lack of follow-through. Success and failure both accumulate over time; they are products of daily 259 \fdecisions. The key is to recognize mistakes early and coursecorrect. 3. You Have to Hunt for Success Just like a lion doesn’t wait for food to fall from the sky, opportunities won’t simply appear. Success requires initiative, resilience, and active pursuit. Those who sit under a tree waiting for luck will be left behind. 4. Master Your Mindset, Master Your Life Success starts internally. The battle between self-doubt and belief is constant. Feeding the right mindset—through journaling, visualization, and intentional thought—determines whether you stay trapped by your past or move forward into your potential. 5. Success Requires Strategic Growth, Not Just Any Opportunity Not every promotion, title, or project is aligned with your purpose. The wrong move—no matter how prestigious—can 260 \ftake you away from your passion. Always assess whether an opportunity fuels your creativity and vision before saying yes. The Keys to Success 1. Audit Your Daily Choices o At the end of each day, ask: Did my actions move me toward success or failure today? o Identify one small adjustment that can improve your trajectory tomorrow. 2. Develop a Failure Analysis Practice o Instead of fearing failure, study it. After a setback, ask: ▪ What did I overlook? ▪ What could I have done differently? ▪ What lesson can I apply moving forward? o Write these reflections down to recognize patterns and make better decisions. 261 \f3. Create a ‘Hunter’s Plan’ for Your Goals o Define one big goal and break it into actionable steps. o Schedule one bold action each week (e.g., pitch an idea, reach out to a mentor, invest time into a new skill). o Track progress and adjust as needed— success isn’t linear. 4. Rewrite Your Inner Narrative o Identify one limiting belief you tell yourself (e.g., “I’m not ready” or “I don’t deserve this”). o Replace it with a new affirmation (e.g., “I am prepared to grow” or “I create my own opportunities”). o Reinforce this mindset by journaling, meditating, or speaking it aloud daily. 5. Vet Every Opportunity Before Saying Yes o Before accepting a new role, project, or challenge, ask: 262 \fo ▪ Does this align with my vision? ▪ Does this fuel my creativity and growth? ▪ What am I giving up to say yes to this? If the answer doesn’t support your long-term vision, walk away with confidence. Let’s Get Free! 263 \fChapter Eleven Facing Down Fear \"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.\" Steve Jobs The Relic and the Hustler Fear could have been the force that kept me from pursuing my dreams of becoming a bestselling writer. I had every excuse: I was too old; the era of hustling books from the trunk was over; the hood book phenomenon had faded. But I chose to say, “Fuck it, I'll give it a go.” I knew that while I might look outdated or out of touch, I could turn those perceptions into advantages. I was a relic from the past, but like all great relics, I believed I held real value. Having spent two decades trapped in a prison time capsule, I embraced my out-of-place look—oversized shorts and baggy tshirts. People laughed, but they also reached for their wallets. I had a powerful story to tell, one that spanned trauma, solitary confinement, and the many atrocities of my young life. And I was delivering it with a smile. I was present, and my presence spoke volumes. 264 \fI knew how to sell. I’d been selling since I was thirteen years old, from drugs on the streets to hustling whatever I could on the prison yard. Deep down, I was a hustler’s hustler, and I knew that other hustlers would see and respect that. They were seeing an OG who had turned his life around. What they didn’t know was that inside this OG was a genius, one who had rediscovered himself through some of the toughest times imaginable. My appearance was a testament to my journey, and I was here to share it with the world. It was my time to go. Facing Fear in Rouge Park I invited family and friends to join me on a book-selling excursion to Rouge Park on Detroit’s west side. Their overwhelming response was “Hell no.” One friend even warned, “Niggas get shot up there all the time.” Despite this, I felt drawn to that place. I wasn’t afraid; I felt inspired and compelled, believing that my audience lived there—the people from the hood who understood my story. I stepped out of my little Honda Civic into the world I knew so well. Hood cars rolled by with big rims shining, music booming from 265 \ftrunks, and scantily clad women danced to the beat. I felt the stares of men tracing my steps, but these were my people. This was my home, and I knew my story would resonate here if it would resonate anywhere. Years later, I would find myself in a similar battle with fear, but on a much bigger stage. In 2014, I received an invitation from June Cohen, head of media for TED, to speak at their 30th anniversary to be held in Vancouver, Canada. This wasn’t just any platform—it was the stage. TED was a global arena where thinkers, innovators, and dreamers shared ideas that they hoped could change the world or at least the conversation. I had been given the opportunity to share my truth about incarceration, redemption, and second chances. But as soon as I accepted the offer, a new fear emerged: my felony record. Canada was going to bar my entry due to my criminal history. After all the work I’d done, after all the progress I’d made personally and professionally, I couldn’t escape a terrible decision I made decades ago. The weight of that reality hit hard. But then, June and 266 \fI came up with a plan: I’d give my talk via livestream from their New York office. The day before my talk, I felt the familiar hum of nerves. What if I messed up? What if I froze in front of the camera? What if I failed? To calm my nerves that night, I headed down to the hotel bar and ended up in a beer-drinking contest with a couple of strangers. I drank myself into a fog, trying to escape the mounting anxiety. The next morning it felt like a sack of cement had been dropped on my head, and a pair of Timberland boots was tumbling around in my stomach. Michael, the speaking coach assigned to me by TED, asked to meet over at the office for a dress rehearsal. I was confused, as I couldn’t quite understand why they wanted me to rehearse how I dressed. I had been putting my clothes on just fine since I was a kid. Confused, I called a friend of mine and asked why they were asking me to rehearse how I dressed. Instead of responding he burst out into laughter and explained to me what it meant. I was learning. 267 \fI headed over to the office and they mic’d me up for a test run via the live stream. On the other side of the screen, Chris Anderson told me to deliver my talk looking at the camera. As I responded that I wasn’t done memorizing the talk yet, I could feel those Timberland boots kicking harder. I could hear my heart beating in my head. Chris told me to just freestyle it so they could make sure everything worked. I stumbled through a half-hearted attempt to remember the talk, and they said everything was working and to come back in a bit after I finished memorizing it. I went into a room off to the side and tried to remember the talk, but every time I put the paper down my mind went blank. I was getting panicked, but then I remembered the advice I had given to a friend who was prepping for his own TEDx talk a couple of years earlier: just tell your story. So, instead of worrying about the script, I decided to speak from my heart. When they were ready for my run-through, I pointed to the camera crew, making them my audience, and I let my story flow out of me, raw and real. But just a few minutes in, static filled my 268 \fearpiece, a technical issue the crew caught relatively quickly. All seemed ready to go well. When it was time to go live, I stood in the middle of the room and started: “Twenty three years ago…’ Before I got to the next line, the earpiece filled with static again. I couldn’t hear myself, and I didn’t know if anyone on the other end could hear me either. “What if they don’t catch it in time?” I thought to myself. Sweat started to roll down my back, and as my hands dampened. For the briefest second my feet felt like cinder blocks as panic rose in my chest In that moment I could have stopped, signaled to the AV team that something was wrong, but I made a choice to keep going. Whether the audio was working or not, I was going to deliver my message, and I did. When my eighteen minutes were over, I had no idea how it had landed in Vancouver. I couldn’t see the faces or hear the reaction from the people on the other side of the camera. Instead there was the camera crew and a small group of people who was invited to the TED office were in front of me. But then my phone buzzed with a text from my friend Baratunde: “Bro, I just 269 \fwatched your talk here at the conference. They gave you a standing ovation.” He later text me the reaction, which I watched throughout the night, as I celebrated with a small group of friends. That moment taught me that fear only topples you if you give into its power. I had learned how to push through. I had learned how to use the fear as fuel. Fear has shown up many times in my career. But here’s the thing: it is a part of the journey. Don’t pretend it’s not there. Acknowledge it, embrace it, and then move forward anyway. Every time I’ve faced and gone past fear, I’ve found the other side holds something far more powerful: freedom. At the end of the day, fear is only as strong as the story you tell yourself about it. Confronting the Inner Voice The most important conversations we have are often the ones with ourselves, yet they are also the most fearsome. Engaging in these dialogues without censorship, filters, or limitations liberated me. The hardest conversation I had was confronting the voice 270 \fwithin—my self-accusing spirit cloaked in shame and humiliation. When I left Navan I was pretty beat up from everything that had transpired over the years. In addition to the death of Sherrod, and Indy, along with Sekou’s diagnosis, I caught Covid four times, developed cluster headaches also known as suicide headaches and had back-to-back dental surgery. Life was beating me down in a way I hadn’t experienced in a long time, which brought up familiar feelings of uncertainty and instability. I was afraid, but knew I had to push on, otherwise I would have been stuck in neutral. The Prison of Fear Fear is a prison we often build ourselves, a fortress constructed from ignorance, antipathy, and the desire to control perceived threats. It paralyzes us, silences us, and keeps us from pursuing the life we want. We fear what people will think, we fear losing love, we fear judgment. Fear doesn’t need to control us. It’s a voice that can be subdued and managed. It’s about recognizing that fear is always present but that we have the power to confront it. For me, naming 271 \fmy fears, understanding their origins, and choosing to face them instead of running away was the path to freedom. Going from Impossible to I’m Possible I had to ask myself, “Who are you if you don’t accomplish everything on your vision board? If success—by society’s standards—never comes, then what?” The fear of failure loomed large, but I came to understand that my worth isn’t defined by accolades, titles, or wealth. My worth comes from within. Yes, I still wanted to achieve the goals I had set, earn the money I desired, and travel the world. But at my core, my deepest desire was simpler—to live a life of creativity, in a way that allowed me to care for my family and stay true to my soul’s calling. So, I ask you: How does this way of thinking impact the quality of your life? Are you fully present with yourself, or are you chasing a version of success that was never truly yours? Are you trusting your divine calling, your inner guide, or are you lost in expectations that don’t align with your spirit? 272 \fThese questions aren’t just for me. They’re yours to carry, to reflect on, and to answer in a way that leads you closer to your truth. Anxiety has been my lifelong companion, manifesting in various ways—worrying about being on time, finding parking, dealing with other people's emotions. It’s easier to handle these things alone than to carry them into interactions with others. Yet, surviving and overcoming these anxieties, and recognizing the survivor’s guilt that comes from succeeding when others do not, has been a profound part of my journey. There’s an actual name for an intense fear of failure: atychiphobia. And of all the things I fear, the most intense for much of my life was a fear of public speaking. Ever since I was a kid, I dreaded exposing my gap teeth and my big head. Yet I found a way to conquer that fear by redirecting that inner energy outwardly. Doing the thing I feared most, with literal static threatening to drag me down, led not only to a standing ovation (which I didn’t even get to see) but to knowing I’m strong enough to handle it. I still get 273 \fnerves – who doesn’t?—but they don’t hold me back. 274 \fChapter Twelve Becoming Unstoppable \"The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.\" Ayn Rand When I think of fearlessness, I think of being unstoppable. And the one image that continually comes to mind is Diana Ross during her iconic Central Park performance. Born in the Brewster Projects of Detroit, Ross wasn’t just a singer—she was and is a force of nature. On that unforgettable day in Central Park, the skies opened up with a raging storm that threatened to stop the show. Yet Diana Ross stayed on stage, hair and dress blowing in the wind, drenched but undeterred, delivering one of the most powerful performances of her career. She didn’t just sing—she commanded the environment, bending the elements to her will. Watching that performance over and over, I related to the way she remained graceful and regal amid the relentless chaos. It reminded me that even in the face of adversity, we have the power to make the world serve us if we refuse to yield. 275 \fThat image of Ross, drenched and unstoppable, stayed with me as I forged my own path. After leaving Navan, I was at another crossroads. I had invested in exercising my stock options and three years of my life, into the company, pouring not just time but money into its success. Even when I knew it was time to move on, fear crept in. I had survived tougher times, no doubt, but this was different. When you’re at the bottom, the stakes are actually pretty low. It’s different when you’re responsible not just for yourself but also for your family. I had to figure out what was next, but instead of letting fear consume me, I went back to the baseline that had carried me through my darkest moments—the belief that I was capable of more, that I was destined for greatness. I didn’t waste time. I had the honor of being a fellow at the Virginia Tech Institute for Leadership in Technology, a prestigious one-year program that integrates humanities into leadership through courses in philosophy, religion, arts, and history. My speaking engagements increased, and I invested in new ventures. I started 276 \fmoderating high-level conversations, like those at the Paid in Full event where I interviewed Hip Hop luminaries Rakim, Scarface and Steve Stoute and the Green Carpet Awards where I worked with Chris Bevans and introduced John Legend for his award. My success wasn’t just about achieving milestones—it was about constantly growing and evolving. Being successful and unstoppable meant believing in my own magic and having a healthy ego. And it also meant pushing forward, regardless of how loud the inner doubts got. I have previously spoken of ego in a negative sense—egotism, arrogance, the need for validation—but there is another side to it, one that deserves nurturing and belief. A strong, healthy ego isn’t about self-importance; it’s about self-trust. It’s the foundation of confidence, the force that allows us to stand firm in our decisions and take bold action. Sigmund Freud recognized this when he said: “The ego represents what we call reason and sanity, in contrast to the id which contains the passions.” In other words, ego—when balanced—grounds us. It keeps fear in check, tempers impulsive desires, and allows us to move 277 \fforward with an unstoppable spirit. Believing in yourself is not just a lofty ideal; it’s a daily practice, especially when you’re locked in a constant battle between your best and worst thoughts. On the toughest days, I leaned into self-talk, reminding myself of my worth and potential. I revisited old journals where I had poured out dreams, challenges, and victories, rediscovering my resilience in the process. I immersed myself in books that inspired me, filling my mind with wisdom and encouragement. Podcasts on entrepreneurship and leadership became a daily ritual, providing insights and stories that reignited my sense of purpose. I didn’t do it alone either—I reached out to my network of friends for motivation and inspiration. Their encouragement reminded me of the power of community and the importance of surrounding myself with people who believed in me. Music also played a significant role. I listened to aspirational hip-hop that spoke directly to my soul, weaving hope and determination into every verse. I went down the proverbial rabbit hole with artists like 278 \fLaRussel, Black Milk, Boldy James along with thestandards that defined my era. The one thing I refused to do was get stuck in a loop of negativity. The moment a negative thought surfaced; I countered it with positive affirmations. I meditated on gratitude, grounding myself in the blessings I already had rather than the challenges I faced. This commitment to shifting my mindset wasn’t just about pushing through—it was about creating a foundation of self-belief that allowed me to see possibilities instead of obstacles, and to keep moving forward with hope and purpose. It’s easy to get caught up in fear, to let it keep you stagnant. Once you’re in your fifties, culture tells you to stop, you’re done being interesting. But there’s so much proof of people my age who found success in their later years. Ray Kroc didn’t start on his path to turn a small burger stand into the global McDonald’s empire until he was fifty-two.. Toni Morrison published The Bluest Eye at forty, later becoming a Nobel Prize-winning literary giant. Samuel L. Jackson spent decades in minor roles before landing his 279 \fbreakthrough roles as Gator Purify in Jungle Fever at 42 and Pulp Fiction at forty-six. Julia Child didn’t introduce the world to French cuisine until she was fifty, proving reinvention has no expiration date. Stan Lee co-created Marvel’s most legendary superheroes in his forties, reshaping pop culture forever. And Harland Sanders was nearly penniless until the franchising breakthrough at age sixty-five that led to KFC being one of the most recognized brands in the world. If they could do it, then why not me? Why not now? I mean Lebron is still balling at forty years old. The key is resilience: pushing through the noise and focusing on your own growth. I think about Kobe Bryant, whose work ethic was legendary. After missing key shots, he didn’t just wallow in defeat. He'd go back to the gym and take hundreds of shots, working on perfecting his craft. That kind of discipline is the difference between ordinary and extraordinary. I used to think success was about chasing dreams, as though the pursuit alone would bring fulfillment. But I’ve come to realize it’s so much deeper than that. Success demands obsession—being 280 \fenthralled, consumed, and deeply committed to the biggest ideals you hold for your life. You have to be a little crazy about yourself, to believe fiercely in possibilities that no one else can see, to create a vision so vivid that it pulls you forward when it would be easier to stop. In solitary confinement, I started writing down everything I wanted to manifest in my life. I wrote myself an imaginary check with the amount I wanted to earn, envisioned the car I wanted to drive, and declared that I would become a bestselling author. I dared to dream bigger than my circumstances, bigger than the walls that confined me. And while it started as an exercise in hope, it became a practice of creation. Today, I approach life the same way—with boldness, magic, and a sense of fun. I dream unapologetically and manifest relentlessly, because I believe in the power of my vision, my imagination, and my ability to create the life I want. I’ve learned that to be a true dreamer and master manifester, you have to embrace 281 \fyour magic, lean into your “crazy,” and, most importantly, enjoy the ride. I have dream dates with my wife, where we sit up and dream together about what we want our lives to be. We go to open houses in the neighborhoods we desire to live in. We stay up watching videos of exotic cars, destinations and places we want to travel to. We are intentional about the action boards we have in our head. This isn’t just about achieving goals—it’s about living fully in the joy of possibility, every single day. I have also had to accept that failure is as much a part of the process as dreaming. The first time I was rejected during a sales pitch, I felt it deeply. But instead of letting it break me, I asked myself the hard questions: Was I being authentic? Did I do my best? The answer at the time was no, and from that moment on, I focused on improving, practicing, and honing my skills. Rejection is part of life, but the ability to push through it is a muscle you build. Whenever I visit prisons now, I am reminded of how far I’ve come. Walking through those gates, hearing the heavy clank of the 282 \fdoors behind me, it’s impossible not to reflect on my journey. I made it out, but so many people are still trapped—not just by the physical walls, but by the mental prisons they’ve built for themselves. It’s heartbreaking because I know those chains, the ones made of anger, shame, grief. During these visits, my purpose is to help men break free from those mental chains. Many don’t believe they’re worthy of freedom—whether it’s literal freedom or freedom of the mind. I’ve been there, stuck in that mindset of survival, believing that my past defined me. But once I shifted my focus, once I believed that success wasn’t just possible but inevitable if I put in the work, everything began to change. Manifesting my dreams became a practice—writing them down, visualizing them with clarity, and speaking them into existence. Each step brought my goals closer, not because of magic alone but because I had rooted them in a belief that felt unshakable. But the real magic? It started with forgiving myself and discovering my self-worth. That sense of self-worth is the secret sauce, the foundation for developing the unshakeable belief that fuels success. When you 283 \fknow you are worthy, everything shifts. You begin to see the universe as an ally rather than an obstacle. You trust that it is perfectly aligned with your deepest desires, that even the struggles and heartbreaks you’ve faced were uniquely designed to shape you into the ultimate version of yourself. As Marianne Williamson so eloquently stated “Do not be afraid of your own greatness. You were born to stand out, not shrink into the shadows.” Self-worth unlocks a deeper understanding of self. It reminds you that you don’t have to prove yourself to anyone. Instead, you work toward your dreams from a place of abundance and alignment, knowing that every experience—good or bad—has prepared you for this moment. When you truly believe you are worthy, you stop waiting for permission to succeed and start creating the life you were meant to live. That’s when the magic really happens. That’s the power of belief. If you can see it, you can achieve it. But it’s not just about seeing the goal—it’s about being willing to do the work every single day. 284 \fMuhammad Ali didn’t become “The Greatest” by winning every fight. His greatest victories often came after crushing defeats. When he fought George Foreman, he spent eight rounds getting pummeled, but he stayed present. He waited for his moment, and then he struck. That’s how life works—you have to stay patient, because that opening will come. If you spend all your time focusing on how many times you’ve been knocked down, you’ll never see the opportunity to rise. Steph Curry, the greatest shooter to ever pick up a basketball, has made 3,822 three-pointers in his career—but he’s also missed 5,151. That’s more misses than most players will ever even attempt. And yet, he keeps shooting. That’s what makes him legendary—not just the makes, but the resilience to keep going, to take the next shot no matter how many he’s missed before. It’s a reminder that greatness is about persistence, not perfection. The people I meet in these prisons are often still trapped by their old stories and patterns. But it’s not just those behind the bars of the thousands of prisons scattered across the world. I see it 285 \feverywhere—people on the outside, living in hidden prisons of grief, anger, shame, and the inability to forgive. But then, there are those who are trapped in the hidden well intentioned prisons—the ones that appear safe, even desirable, yet quietly erode the soul. The good prisons of the helicopter parent who never lets go, the lover-turned-friend who stays out of comfort rather than love, , the CEO who wears a mask of toughness because vulnerability feels like weakness, the imposter syndrome that whispers, you don’t belong here, and the gilded cage of privilege, where comfort breeds complacency. So many bars, seen and unseen. So many hidden prisons, built in the mind and mistaken for freedom. But I’m living proof that you can break free, not just from the walls, but from the mental chains that keep you stuck in old cycles. My mission now is to help others find that freedom, to show them that there’s a way out if they’re willing to put in the work. I know what it feels like to doubt yourself, to hear that voice in your head that tells you you’re not good enough. I know what it feels 286 \flike to be broken into pieces. But I’ve also learned how to silence that voice,put myself back together and make deposits into my own narrative bank. We’re quick to praise others, but we rarely do it for ourselves. But there is power in affirming oneself.That’s why I challenge people to stand in front of the mirror and speak life into themselves. Because if you don’t believe in your greatness, why should anyone else? People like LeBron James or Muhammad Ali weren’t arrogant when they proclaimed themselves as the greatest. They were simply acknowledging their own potential, their own magic. And that’s what I’ve come to believe about myself. I didn’t just survive—I thrived. I put in the work, disciplined my mind, and believed in my potential. Now my mission is to help others do the same, to find their unstoppable spirit and manifest the lives they deserve. Because the truth is, we’re all capable of greatness. We just have to believe it. The Unstoppable Spirit Fearlessness isn’t the absence of fear—it’s the audacity to move forward despite it. It’s about standing in the storm, unshaken, 287 \flike Diana Ross in Central Park, drenched but undeterred. That image of resilience and grace reminds me that success is not about waiting for perfect conditions but about showing up, rain or shine, and owning your power. Throughout my journey, I’ve learned that being unstoppable isn’t about luck, talent, or even opportunity—it’s about mindset, discipline, and the willingness to push past fear, doubt, and failure. It’s about believing in yourself when no one else does. And it’s about breaking free from the prisons—both real and imagined—that keep you from stepping into your greatness. The keys to becoming unstoppable 1.Success Is Earned, Not Given It’s easy to look at successful people and assume they had it easier, but the truth is, success is the result of consistent, intentional effort over time. Just like Kobe Bryant, who spent hours in the gym 288 \fafter every missed shot success belongs to those who show up every day and put in the work. Action Step: ● Identify one area in your life where you need to be more disciplined. ● Set a small, measurable goal and commit to it daily. (e.g., Write 500 words a day, practice your craft for an hour, network with one new person per week.) 2: Master Your Mindset, Master Your Life The biggest battle isn’t external—it’s the war in your own mind. Self-doubt, imposter syndrome, and limiting beliefs keep most people from reaching their full potential. But the difference between those who succeed and those who don’t isn’t talent—it’s belief. When you tell yourself you are worthy, capable, and destined for more, your actions start to align with that truth. Action Step: 289 \f● Daily self-talk: Start each morning by looking in the mirror and affirming your power. Say: I am worthy. I am capable. I am enough. ● Rewire your beliefs: Write down the negative thoughts you struggle with. Next to each, write a new, empowering belief to replace it. 3: Fear Is a Compass, Not a Stop Sign Fear isn’t a signal to stop—it’s a sign that you’re stepping into something greater. The key is not to let fear paralyze you, but to let it guide you. Every major leap in my life—from leaving Navan to stepping onto big stages—came with fear. But I did it anyway. Courage is action in the face of fear. Action Step: ● List three things you’ve been avoiding due to fear. ● Take one small action toward each, even if it’s just making a call, sending an email, or writing a plan. 290 \f4: Build a Support System That Elevates You Success isn’t a solo journey. Even the greats had a team— Jordan had Pippen, Ali had his trainers, and I have a network of friends, mentors, and supporters who challenge and uplift me. Surrounding yourself with people who believe in you is one of the most powerful success hacks. Action Step: ● Identify three people who inspire and challenge ● Schedule a coffee, call, or check-in with one of you. them this week. 5: Manifestation Requires Action Dreaming without action is just wishful thinking. I’ve always been a dreamer, but what made the difference was writing things down, visualizing them, and then doing the work to bring them to life. From making vision boards with my wife to attending open 291 \fhouses in our dream neighborhood, I learned that manifestation isn’t magic—it’s intention plus effort. Action Step: ● Create a vision journal and write down your biggest dreams in vivid detail. ● Identify one concrete step you can take this week to move toward one of those dreams. Every single person who has achieved greatness has had moments of doubt, fear, and failure. But what separates them from the rest is that they didn’t stop. They kept going when it was hard, when it was lonely, when the odds were stacked against them. You have that same power. You don’t need permission to step into your greatness. You don’t need validation to chase what sets your soul on fire. You just need the belief, the discipline, and the courage to take action—even when you’re scared, even when the storm is raging. 292 \fSuccess isn’t about waiting for the right moment. It’s about becoming unstoppable in the face of whatever comes your way. So, the question is—are you ready to step into your power as the freest version of yourself? 293 \fChapter Thirteen Finding True Freedom \"True freedom is impossible without a mind made free by discipline.\" — Mortimer J. Adler I was ten years old when I first heard Prince’s “Free,” and the lyrics have echoed in my mind ever since: \"Be glad that you are free Free to change your mind” At the time, I didn’t fully understand the depth of those words. Freedom to a child feels simple — running outside without a curfew, exploring the world without boundaries. But as I grew older— especially after serving nineteen years in prison—my understanding of freedom evolved. I came to realize that real freedom has less to do with where you are and everything to do with how you feel inside. These lyrics resonate so deeply with me as they capture what I’ve come to understand: freedom isn’t just a physical condition. You can be free from the bars of a prison but still be trapped in your 294 \fmind. And you can walk around every day, not confined by walls, yet still be imprisoned by fear, anger, grief, or shame. Freedom is a mental, emotional, and spiritual journey, and meditation on freedom is the gateway to your authentic self. It invites you to imagine a life unburdened by past grievances and fears. Consider what your life would look like if you were truly free. How would you feel? Would you dance, smile, exercise, or laugh out loud? The reality is that you can do all those things right now. But you have to give up the prison of fear. Fear of the unknown, of failure, of being found out, of embarrassment—these fears are deeply rooted in shame and keep us shackled to the narratives we’ve inherited or built around ourselves. Every time we replay an insult from the past, dwell on an experience where we felt slighted, or let someone else's judgment dictate our choices, we tighten the handcuffs around our wrists. We render ourselves powerless, locked in cycles of self-doubt and limitation. 295 \fTrue freedom begins the moment we confront these fears and make the choice to live differently. It’s about recognizing the layers of fear that society, upbringing, and our own insecurities have piled onto us. The fear of aging in a culture that idolizes youth and marginalizes the wisdom and beauty of growing older. The fear of other people’s narrow worldviews, as if their limited perspectives somehow diminish our truth. The fear of not being enough—smart enough, attractive enough, wealthy enough—or of being unworthy of love and acceptance. These fears, so pervasive and insidious, convince us to play small, to hide, to defer our dreams and live by someone else’s rules. But freedom doesn’t come from avoiding fear; it comes from acknowledging it and refusing to let it dictate our lives. It’s learning to see the cracks in those fears, the light that seeps through when we choose courage over comfort. It’s reminding ourselves that fear is often a reflection of what we care about most, and that stepping through it is how we claim our power. Whether it’s the fear of failing at something new, the fear of aging, or the fear of not living up to 296 \fexpectations, freedom lies in embracing those fears and choosing to move forward anyway. Living differently means rewriting the stories fear has written for us and stepping boldly into the unknown. It means showing up as our authentic selves, with all our imperfections and vulnerabilities, and understanding that true worth isn’t found in external validation, but in the courage to be free from the chains of shame and judgment. Only then can we begin to live fully, unapologetically, and without limits. I will never forget the excitement that washed over me as a kid watching an old film about the world’s greatest escape artist Harry Houdini. It was mesmerizing watching him free himself from what seemed like impossible situations—handcuffs, straightjackets, even submerged tanks filled with water. Later, I was captivated by the feats of David Copperfield with his escape from Alcatraz and by David Blaine’s frozen-in-time event where he was encased in a block of ice for sixty-three hours. These men weren’t just magicians; they 297 \fwere escape artists who dared to defy the odds. They didn’t just escape; they made us believe that the impossible could be possible. I wasn’t a magician, but life demanded that I become an escape artist of my own kind. My stage wasn’t lit with bright lights, and there were no crowds holding their breath as I worked. My acts of escape were quiet, unseen, and deeply personal. The stakes, however, were just as high—my freedom, my survival, and ultimately, my life. One of my prisons was physical, with real bars, real locks, and real walls. But as confining as that space was, it wasn’t nearly as powerful as the mental prisons I discovered while serving time. The cell I lived in for years was tangible, but the ones in my mind were insidious, hidden, and far more difficult to escape. These mental prisons took many forms: the narratives I had been told about myself, the guilt and shame that played on repeat, and the belief that my circumstances defined my worth. These invisible walls felt so real they almost had the verisimilitude of freedom. Almost. 298 \fBut it wasn’t just about my own prisons—I came to realize that we are all trapped in one way or another. For many of us, these prisons aren’t as obvious as steel bars. They’re the relentless churn of the news cycle, designed to keep us in a state of fear and anxiety. They’re the FOMO (fear of missing out) that drives us to compare our lives to curated versions of success we see online. They’re the endless doom scrolling, feeding us despair one swipe at a time. Then there are the deeper, more personal prisons: comparing our lives to those of celebrities and influencers who make their perfection seem effortless. The pain of a marred childhood that we carry like an invisible weight. The toxic relationships we cling to out of fear or habit. And even the cultural mindset of entitlement, which traps us in a cycle of discontent, always wanting more but never feeling enough. Escaping these prisons requires more than just awareness; it demands intention, effort, and a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths. Like Houdini studying every lock and mechanism, I had to develop an acuity for spotting the traps in my 299 \fthinking, the patterns that kept me stuck. It required perspicacious self-awareness to discern what was holding me back and the courage to believe that I could break free. In the process, I became a raconteur of my own freedom, rewriting the story of my life with each escape. Every time I slipped out of a limiting belief or freed myself from the weight of the past, I added a new chapter to the tale. Escaping wasn’t just about getting out—it was about building something better on the other side. What I’ve learned is that the art of escaping isn’t about brute force or luck. It’s about strategy, mindset, and determination. It’s about recognizing the prisons we’re in, no matter how subtle or normalized they might seem, and finding a way to slip free—not through rebellion or destruction, but through clarity and intention. Life’s prisons may look different for each of us, but the path to freedom is universal. It starts with this simple truth: the key isn’t out there—it’s within you. You just have to find it. And when you do, you’ll discover that freedom isn’t just the absence of confinement. It’s the presence of possibility. 300 \fBecause the greatest escape isn’t just about getting out. It’s about breaking through to a life that’s truly yours. The Ecosystem of Freedom Freedom is like an ecosystem. It requires balance: owning our truth, being accountable to it, speaking it, creating space for it, and living it. But when the ecosystem is out of balance, we risk lashing out, avoiding healthy relationships, fighting ghosts, resisting love, or re-imprisoning ourselves. Mindfulness brings you back to the moment of truth, reminding you that the only freedom that exists is in the now—not in yesterday or tomorrow. Our most valuable asset is time. Once it's gone, we can't get it back, so it's crucial to value it today and maximize each moment's potential. A free life must include joy—both spontaneous and intentional. A life without joy is a broken life filled with sorrow. Setting a Freedom Date One of the most powerful steps toward freedom is setting a \"freedom date.\" This is the day you commit to liberating yourself from the mental and emotional prisons you've built. Just like 301 \fcounting down the days in confinement, you need to set a future date that signifies your new beginning, your separation from the past. Write it down—on a piece of paper, in your journal, or even in the margins of this book. Set it in stone in your mind and don't move it for anyone. When that day comes, dress in your best outfit and go out into the world as if you've just been released from a long sentence. Live it up to the fullest and bask in the freedom you achieved. The Journey of Self-Discovery and Healing My journey toward freedom started when I realized I was incarcerated long before I entered prison, and I was free long before my release. Through journaling, mindfulness, and meditation, I unlocked the mental bars that had held me back since childhood. From there, it has been one step at a time—sometimes with a sidestep or two. This process led me to several truths: 1. My authentic self is both amazing and deserving of amazing things. 302 \f2. Ultimate freedom is expressed through dominion over my own thoughts. 3. Manifestation requires constant patience and practice. 4. Obstacles are part of the journey. Growth comes from using the keys within us to unlock the doors in front of us. It took a lot of journaling, meditation, and giving up the old narratives that had kept me imprisoned. But freedom comes with the understanding that the old narratives don’t go away easily; they fight to stick around. Twenty years ago I wrote this in my journal, and it still applies to this day. Journal Entry: May 31, 2005 It’s been over a year since I’ve been out of the hole, and just as long since I last wrote in my journal. A lot has changed in that time. One of the most significant changes is that I’ve become much more aware of myself. Through writing, I’ve learned to see myself clearly. I’ve made progress in controlling my anger, though there are still moments when I feel vexed. The difference now is that I have a greater desire—and ability—to control my response to the things 303 \fthat upset me. This shift has been transformative, helping me maintain my focus and stay grounded. Though I am out of prison, the stories I told myself at my lowest point come up from time to time, but now I can combat them a lot easier. Resurrecting the Artist Within For me, freedom is deeply tied to creativity and imagination. I had to resurrect the artist within myself, embracing the language of freedom, which includes liberty, dreaming, visualization, activism, and activation. Writing became my way of unleashing my subconscious, birthing something meaningful into the world. Although I once dreamed of being a visual artist, I learned to paint pictures with words, inspired by the golden era of hip-hop artists like Rakim, Scarface, and Ice Cube, who depicted inner-city life with such vivid storytelling. Through this journey, I also rediscovered the thing that sets my soul on fire—fiction writing. I’ve spent years writing, speaking, and 304 \fcoaching, but the part of me that dreams wildly and tells stories is ready to take center stage. This is the next chapter of my creative journey—bringing my fiction to the world. In solitary confinement, after I wrote of the text that would become my first book and was cursed out by a man in a cell a few doors down, I developed some apprehension about sharing my writing. The sting of rejection, even from another incarcerated man, made me question whether my words were worth putting into the world. But once I got out of solitary and started sharing my work, the response was overwhelmingly positive. Word spread through the cell block, and soon, I had to create a sign-up list just so men could take turns reading my books—books that I had written by hand, in the quiet of my confinement, unsure if they would ever mean anything to anyone but me. That experience taught me something: fear of sharing is universal, but so is the power of connection. It made me think about the greats—how many of them almost let their doubts keep them from releasing their work. 305 \fMaya Angelou struggled with sharing her voice. Trauma silenced her for years, and even as she wrote I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, she feared how the world would react. But she shared it anyway, and in doing so, she gave countless others the courage to tell their own stories. Tyler, The Creator was laughed at for his music. Industry insiders dismissed him as too weird, too different. But instead of changing to fit their mold, he built his own lane, creating music for the people who did get it. Now, those same people who doubted him watch as he headlines festivals and wins Grammys. Vincent van Gogh painted in obscurity, never knowing if his work would matter. He only sold one painting in his lifetime. Imagine if he had stopped. Imagine if he had let his fears keep him from creating. Today, his art is priceless, his name immortal. And then there’s me. Sitting in a prison cell, wondering if my words mattered. But I pushed past the fear, shared anyway, and saw how stories—my stories—could move people, even in the darkest of places. 306 \fThe truth is, every artist, every creator, every visionary has been afraid to share their work. But the ones who change the world are the ones who do it anyway. Once I awakened the artist within, writing became my lifeline. It gave my life meaning and purpose, helping me realize that it's never too late to pursue your passions, no matter how outdated or out of touch they may seem. So, what’s stopping you? Living in the Now The only freedom that exists is in the now. Freedom thinking shifts everything inside of you. It reveals a lightness in your step, a brightness in your smile—you are in your essence. It's a state where you are not just free from external constraints but liberated from the internal ones that keep you from living fully. You don’t have to wait until society says you are fit, or the parole board says you are ready. You can escape at this very moment, without fear of being shot down by a guard or caught in concertina wire. But you have to make 307 \fthe choice to stay or go. Now take some time out today and lean into this powerful meditation. Meditation on Freedom in the Now Find a quiet space. Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath in… hold it for a moment… and exhale slowly. Inhale… feel the air expand within you. Exhale… release anything that feels heavy. Let yourself settle into this moment. Right here. Right now. The Present Is Where Freedom Lives The only freedom that exists is in the now—not in the past that lingers behind you, not in the future that hasn't arrived. Freedom is here, in this breath, in this stillness. Feel your body relax as you step fully into this moment. Feel the weight of old regrets, past hurts, and unspoken fears begin to loosen. They do not belong to you right now. They only exist if you hold onto them. 308 \fBreathe in lightness—a step unburdened. Breathe out heaviness—all that you no longer need. The Choice to Be Free In this space, you are not trapped. You are not waiting. You do not need permission to be free. No external force can hold you. Freedom is an internal decision. Picture yourself standing before two doors—one is labeled \"stay\", the other \"go.\" This is your choice. The door of the past may call to you—memories, regrets, old narratives of who you were. But you hold the key. You can lock that door if it no longer serves you. Or perhaps, there is a part of you still held hostage—an old fear, a painful experience, a version of yourself that longs to be released. If you are ready, unlock that door. Free them. Free yourself. Freedom Thinking Shifts Everything 309 \fBreathe in and feel the lightness in your body. Breathe out, and let go of anything that no longer aligns with the person you are becoming. Freedom is a state of mind. It is not earned. It is claimed. And you, right now, are claiming it. Returning to the Present Slowly bring your awareness back to your breath. Feel the space around you. Know that you are free—not someday, not when circumstances change—but right now. Take this freedom with you. Walk with it. Speak with it. Live from it. When you are ready, open your eyes. You are free. You have always been free. And now, you know it. Creating Your Freedom Blueprint To truly embrace freedom, we must design our own freedom ecosystem. This includes setting freedom boundaries, defining the 310 \fthings that protect our freedom, and creating personal mantras that reinforce our liberated state. Here is an example of what that Mantra can look like for you: I don’t have to wait to be free. I am free right now. I am free from the weight of my past. I don’t owe my old mistakes my future. I don’t carry the baggage of shame, guilt, or regret. They don’t define me—I do. Whether it’s a freedom checklist, a freedom manual, or a freedom journal, the goal is to build a personal blueprint that guides you toward a life of agency, empowerment, and fulfillment. Ultimately, freedom is about gratitude. The greatest expression of freedom is trusting that the moment you’re in is divine and worthy of your presence. Be Thankful for this very moment, this very freedom and for the choice you made to liberate yourself. 311 \fThe Basement of Fear: Confronting Hidden Traumas I hated the basement of our childhood home; I imagined it filled with creeps who were waiting for me to descend the stairs. No matter how many times I had to go down to that cellar, I couldn't shake my anxiety - even though those monsters never materialized. We all have basements in our minds where fears reside. To grow, we must venture into these dark spaces, confront the hidden fears and real trauma is exposed then to the light. Manifestation: Trusting the Creator’s Promise Manifestation is the process of trusting the Creator’s promise and having faith that the universe is aligning in your favor. It’s like holding onto the belief that the Creator’s plan is unfolding as it should, even when the road is unclear. This belief in manifestation is akin to planting seeds without knowing exactly when they’ll sprout but trusting that the bloom will come. The Courage to Be Free 312 \fWhen I first sat down to write this book, I had no idea how much more liberated I would feel by the end of it. Writing has always been my tool for transformation, but this process forced me to confront my own limitations and take action in ways I hadn’t before. One of the biggest steps I took was finally applying for my pardon. For years, I carried the weight of my past—grieving the time lost to prison, feeling the sting of having to check “yes” every time I was asked if I had been convicted of a crime, and battling the shame when my past affected my family. I was tired of it. So instead of just sitting with frustration, I did something about it. I set aside time, downloaded the application, filled it out, and submitted it. It’s been months since I sent it off, and I still don’t have an answer. But here’s the thing—I already feel lighter. Not because someone granted me permission to move forward, but because I took ownership of my own freedom. And that’s the lesson I want to leave you with: freedom isn’t something we wait for. It’s something we claim. 313 \fEmbracing the Next Chapter Today, I sit in a spirit of gratitude. I am grateful for Sherrod and Indy and the impact they’ve had on my life. I am grateful for Sekou’s resilience—how he’s taking control of his health with a strength that humbles me. It still blows my mind, and sometimes brings me to tears, watching him administer his own insulin shots. But more than anything, I am proud of him. I am grateful for the joyful moments I share with my wife Liz, dreaming and imagining the next phase of our lives together. But gratitude doesn’t just sit in my mind—it pushes me into action. To be clear, journaling, meditation, creating an action board or creating a mantra are not passive exercises. It’s not some set-itand-forget-it process. If you’re doing it right, if you’re sitting with your truth, it will force you to take action. It will force you to get off your ass and grab life by the reins. Because here’s the truth: 314 \fIt doesn’t have to be perfect. But it does have to be a process. It has to be progress. You Were Not Put Here to Play Small I had to ask myself a hard question: Why was I so comfortable in pain and chaos? Why did peace scare me so much? The answer? Because I had grown accustomed to the abnormal being normal. For so long, I equated struggle with survival, with identity, with meaning. But once I called that out, I began the arduous journey of steadying myself in peace. Of allowing myself to live in joy without waiting for the other shoe to drop. This is the work of in freedom thinking. This is the work of becoming whole. This is the work of owning your space in the world. Start Before You’re Ready 315 \fWhen I first started writing, I had no idea what I was doing. All I knew was that I loved words. My grasp of punctuation was basic at best—I could handle a question mark, a period, an exclamation point, but semicolons and colons? That was a different story. But I didn’t let what I didn’t know stop me. During my incarceration, I devoured books—nearly 1,500 of them. Westerns, fiction, philosophy—you name it. But despite all that reading, I wasn’t a trained writer. I wasn’t an MFA graduate, a grammar expert, or a punctuation specialist. None of the traditional markers of a “writer” applied to me. Still, I wrote. I tried. I put pen to paper and let the stories take shape. And in the process, I realized that success isn’t about waiting until you’re ready—it’s about starting. It’s about giving yourself permission to do the work. That applies to anything—writing, speaking, entrepreneurship, relationships. You don’t need someone to tell you you’re qualified. 316 \fYou don’t need the perfect degree, the right connections, or a permission slip. What you need is the willingness to begin. Friendship, Purpose, and the Power of Showing Up Finding your purpose is one of the most important things you can do. But here’s what I’ve learned: Purpose isn’t a finish line—it’s a practice. It’s something you pursue daily, through the choices you make, the people you surround yourself with, and the way you show up in the world. And let’s be clear—friendship matters. Not the surface-level kind. Not the “I’ll hit you up when I need something” kind. Real friendship. The kind that sharpens you, holds you accountable, and reminds you of who the hell you are when you forget. If you have those people in your life, cherish them. And if you don’t— go find them. Because the truth is, none of us were meant to do this alone. 317 \fYour Freedom, Your Choice As I close this book, I want to leave you with this: You were not placed in the arena, in these big rooms, in these powerful spaces to play small. You were not given the gift of thought, creativity, and vision just to sit on the sidelines. You don’t have to wait until society decides you are fit. You don’t have to wait until the parole board says you’re ready. You don’t have to wait until the world gives you permission to be free. You can claim your freedom—right now. Right here. At this very moment. The only question is: Are you going to take it?

Box 23176 Detroit, MI 48223 Dedication Acknowledgements Introduction \t  Prologue I stared at the mirror watching the tears roll slowly down my face, each drop carrying the pain of my childhood.  It was my deepest moment of reflection, a sacred moment in time where I came face-to-face with true forgiveness. I stared at my battle-scarred image and began the long, tedious process of forgiving. I forgave all of the people who had teased me in my childhood, making fun of my jack-o-lantern-sized head, which earned me the nickname, Pumpkin.  I forgave everyone who had made fun of my gap-toothed smile.  While I still have my issues with the chasm between my teeth, I have learned to smile when I see other successful owners of the gap.  Whether it is watching Michael Strahan analyze football on Fox Sports or reminiscing about the days when “Uncle Luke” and the 2 Live Crew reigned supreme, I find solace in knowing that they made it although they didn’t have picture perfect smiles.  In forgiving, I opened up deep wounds that I had stuffed with the gauze of self-hatred and low self-esteem.  The words from my past ricocheted off the walls of my mind like an errant bullet fired from an AK 47.  As each word whizzed by in a blur, my instincts told me to duck.  However, I knew I had to trust the Kevlar vest of self-love to protect me as I stood in the line of fire.  Bravely, I faced the fusillade of thoughts from my past.   I forgave everyone who ever called me nappy-headed, making me feel insecure about the royal crown that the Creator had bestowed upon me.  I ran my hands through my long locs, which cascaded over my shoulders like velvet.  I forgave my mother for all of the ass whoopings she gave me as I reflected back on the fire of the belt cutting into my tender flesh.  I also forgave her for all of the moments she wasn’t there when I needed her most.       I forgave my siblings and homies for abandoning me when I was at the lowest point in my life.  I also forgave the guy who shot me and made me feel like I had to carry a gun.   The levees broke and the tears flowed with the turbulence of the Mississippi in the spring as I inhaled and exhaled, breathing in a deep, abiding peace and exhaling the toxic hatred from my past.   I had heard a lot about the healing power of forgiveness, but it took me several years to fully appreciate the power of forgiving others. I didn’t forgive them to let them off the hook or to free them of their culpability.  This was about me.   I had to free myself from the anger, fear and hurt of my past, so I had to forgive them.  But more importantly, I had to forgive myself.  It was one of the hardest things I had ever done, because I didn’t feel I was worthy of forgiveness.  Guilt from all of the hurt, destruction and disappointment that I had caused others clung to me like a sweaty T-shirt on a humid summer day, but I knew in my heart that it was a necessary part of my atonement process.  If I wanted to make it right with others, I had to make it right with myself first.  In order to feel like I was worthy of their forgiveness and capable of forgiving them, I had to forgive myself for all the hurt I had brought into my own life.      It was in this moment that I realized no one could make me feel anything I didn’t want to feel.  I was ultimately responsible for my anger and the actions that I took in response to it.  Thus began my eight-year journey to forgiveness, which culminated with me writing a letter of forgiveness to the victim of my crime.   During one of my group therapy sessions I wrote the following letter.  Out of respect to my victim’s family and their privacy I have omitted his named. The letter reads as follows: Dear Mr. *****, I am writing this letter to share with you what has been on my mind and in my heart for several years now.  For the last few nights, I have stayed awake writing this letter in my head, and each time, I found myself mentally balling up the pages because I couldn’t find the right words to convey how deeply sorry I am for causing your death.  Somehow saying I am sorry for robbing you and your family of your life seems too small of a gesture. Every time I think back to that fateful night, I often find myself asking the question, “Why didn’t I just walk away?”  When I finally found the answer, I understood for the first time the true meaning of the words ‘weakness’ and ‘strength.’  See, all along I had twisted their meaning around in my head.  I thought walking away from an argument would make me appear weak and make me a loser.  But in reality, it takes strength to walk away from conflict, and back then that was something I was lacking. Instead of being as strong and powerful as I imagined myself to be, I was the epitome of weakness; I was afraid and I allowed my fears to dictate my actions.  See, I was wearing a mask of ‘hood toughness, but underneath that façade were deep-rooted fears and insecurities.  Sixteen months prior to me shooting you, I was shot in a similar incident.  I allowed the fear from my shooting to consume me.  Instead of seeing it as an isolated incident, I programmed myself to think that it could happen again at any given moment.  I became desperately angry because anger was the only emotion that could conceal the fear I had inside of me.  Anger became my mask and carrying a gun with me everywhere I went became my shield.  So when we encountered each other, I was already programmed to kill.  I had convinced myself that it was better to shoot than to be shot.  In my mind at the time, it was easier to shoot than to walk away, and sadly, it took me years to understand how wrong I was.  For years, I blamed you for making me mad enough to shoot, but I realize now that no on can make me feel anything I don’t want to feel.  I blamed your death on the fact that we were both intoxicated, but now I recognize that the thought to shoot anyone I perceived as a threat had been planted long before we met.  I blamed everything and everyone but myself, even though I pled guilty.  Pleading guilty was easy because I knew I had violated the law, but it didn’t mean I was taking full responsibility for causing your death.  It wasn’t until I was ten years into serving my sentence that I began taking responsibility for causing your death.  It started with a letter I received from my son.  His letter made me face up to the fact that it was my thinking and the choices I made that caused your death and led to me being incarcerated.  Today when I look back, I wish I could change the past.  I wish I could restore your life so that your children could have enjoyed the safety and security of having a father in the house.  I wish I could bring you back to life so that your wife could enjoy the presence of her husband and your parents could see you reach your dreams and goals.  I know saying I am sorry can never restore your life.  However, I believe in the power of atonement, and I have taken responsibility for taking your life by dedicating my life and talents to atoning.  For the last five years, I have been actively involved with anti-violence organizations that work with at-risk youth.  I have used my talent as a writer to share our story so that others may learn from it and make wiser choices than I did as a teenager.  If nothing else, know that your life and the time I am serving in prison hasn’t and will not be in vain.   Lastly, I hope at some point that you can find it in your spirit to forgive me.  I learned about the power of forgiveness from your stepmother, Mrs. Weaver.  She started writing me five years into my sentence.  She wanted to know what occurred that night to cause me to shoot and kill you.  That was one of the hardest questions I’ve ever had to answer, however I knew that I owed your family closure.  I responded and told them about our dispute; however, I chose to leave out the fact that it was a drug transaction.  I didn’t feel that it was necessary for them to be exposed to that part of your life.  When Mrs. Weaver told me that she forgave me and encouraged me to seek God’s forgiveness, I took her words to heart.  It took years before I was able to finally forgive myself, but it has helped.  It helped me to see that even though I forgave myself, I still had a lot of work to do, and each day I am blessed with, I have the will to live with meaning and purpose.   Thank you for taking the time out to weigh and consider what I have shared with you in this letter.   Sincerely, Shaka  Chapter 1 \tThe piercing sound of sirens blaring burst through the quiet morning air and startled me from my restless slumber.  I crawled from beneath the thin, scratchy, wool blanket and approached the cold, grey cell bars.  I watched a chubby roach navigate its way across the bars before I hollered down the tier.  \t“Yo, Satan, what the fuck they hit the siren for,” I asked as I wiped the crust from the corner of my eyes.  \tSatan was from Inkster and one of the few cats I spoke to on a regular basis.  Though we were from different cities, we had a lot in common and had formed a bond during the time I was in county jail.  \t“I don’t know, homie,” he responded from a few cells down.  “You know how they do around here.  They probably hate that they ass can’t get no sleep, so they fucking with us,” he continued, causing a few other inmates to laugh.   \tSatan’s statement expressed the sentiment of most of the cats on lockdown; the pigs would do anything they could to make our stay as unbearable as possible.   While their theory worked in the movies, it rarely, if ever, worked in real life.  Most of us had come from environments where abuse, violence and disrespect were the norm.  It went against common sense to think that you could change a person for the better by treating him or her like an animal.  The way I see it, you get out of people what you put into them. \t“They might be coming to get y’all and take y’all to different county jails,” another inmate called from further down the tier.  “Come get us for what?” Satan asked, a bit irritated. “Man, they take that escape shit serious.  Ain’t nobody tried to pull off that shit y’all just tried,” he said, eluding to the escape attempt that Satan and I were in the hole for. “Bitch ass nigga, mind your business ‘cause you speaking on shit you don’t even know about.  You working with the police or something, saying some shit like that?  You don’t know if them brothers tried to escape or not.  You trying to get niggas indicted around this bitch,” another brother hollered from my end of the tier, causing everyone to burst into laughter.  “Man, I was just saying,” the first inmate stammered. “That’s the problem now, so shut the fuck up!” the brother responded, leading to more laughter. I sat on the corner of my bunk and listened to them argue back and forth as the siren continued blaring.  It felt weird listening to two guys that I didn’t know speak with so much authority about something I was accused of doing.  It had been as week since me, Satan, Gee, Whiteboy, and Jabo had been placed in the hole.  We were charged with attempting to escape from the sixth floor of the Wayne County Jail.  With no evidence other than a confidential statement made by another inmate, we were found guilty and sentenced to 15 days in the hole.   Two days after being thrown in the hole, we were each called out by an officer from the Internal Affairs division.   He threatened each of us with lengthy sentences and promised us the world if we snitched on one another.  One by one, we refused to answer any questions regarding the escape attempt and the matter was dropped as far as Internal Affairs was concerned.  However, the Wayne County Hearing Officer, who was basically an internal, autonomous judge and jury, found us guilty and sentenced us to 15 days in the hole.  It was an irony that vexed us to no end.  In jail and in prison, when a confidential informant makes a statement against an inmate, it is enough to find him or her guilty of any charge.  However, when we have witnesses who are capable of exonerating us, their testimony is ruled no good.   Understanding the embarrassment that the Wayne County Sherriff’s Office had suffered as a result of the almost-successful escape attempt, it was feasible that they could be coming to get us and ship us off to different county jails.  We would quickly learn, however, that what we were accused of was minor in comparison to what led the siren to be sounded.  After nearly half an hour of blaring, the siren suddenly grew quiet, leaving in its wake an eerie silence.  Within moments, we could hear the sounds of keys jingling and the urgent crackling of deputies’ radios.  Little did we know, it would quickly become the soundtrack of chaos.  Minutes after the siren stopped, a team of deputies, better known as the goon squad, rushed our tier and began snatching us out of our cells, one at a time. They wore an assortment of looks on their faces, from astonishment to sadness and anger.  The officer who came and removed me was one of the few who we considered cool.  He usually came to work cracking jokes and talking shit to lighten the mood.  He understood, for the most part, that we were all miserable.  Most of us were facing serious charges and it was likely that we would be spending the bulk, if not all, of our lives in prison.  Unlike most officers who thought it was their personal duty to add to our misery, he did what he could to make our day a little brighter. Most days, he would leave the entrance door to our tier cracked and turn on the radio.  It was a small gesture that went a long way as the sounds of FM 98 broke up the monotony of the hole.   When the officer came to my cell, he had a look of total disbelief on his face.  I could sense that there was something seriously wrong when he ordered me to step out of the cell.  As he escorted me around the corner to another cell, I asked him what was going on.  He hesitated before he spoke.  “Somebody shot and killed Sergeant Dickerson,” he responded solemnly.  “Do they think we had something to do with it?” I asked, trying to fit the pieces of the puzzle together in my head.  “No, they’re just taking precautions,” he whispered as another officer approached with handcuffs in tow.   It wasn’t until later on that day that we would find out what happened. The details of that fateful September morning astounded us as much as it did the officers.  It was an ingenious escape plot made for Hollywood.  An inmate who shall remain nameless was accused of smuggling a gun into the county jail.  Allegedly, he threw a hand-made rope out of the window and had someone tie a gun to it.  According to the allegations, he was on his way to court when he pulled out the gun in an attempt to liberate himself.  A scuffle ensued, and when the dust settled, Officer Dickerson lay dead.   Two days later, I was on a van heading upstate.  It was a somber exclamation point that marked the end of my stay in Wayne County Jail.  In the two months I was there, I had witnessed the worst that exists in humans who live lives filled with desperation.  From rape and robbery to murder, I had seen it, and it reminded me of my twisted life on the streets.  Little did I know, the violent tug-of-war between inmates and officers was just beginning.  Chapter 2  “Wayne County Jail” were three words that every hustler and street thug in the Metro Detroit area feared hearing.  The stories of violence, corruption and desperation were legendary.  In the tall, inconspicuous building that looked as though it had been stuffed down into the earth where it stood on St. Antoine was a sub-culture that could only be described as primitive.  All signs of civility were recklessly discarded at the door like a used tampon.  The only law was the law of the jungle – survival of the fittest.   In the early eighties during the heyday of Young Boys Incorporated, the infamous drug ring of street lore, the county jail’s reputation for violence skyrocketed.  With tiers named after characters from the popular cartoon Transformers, few were safe from unprovoked attacks organized by other inmates.  From robberies, beatings and rape, anyone entering was subject to a violent attack.   I sat in a dingy cell on 1300 Beaubien at police headquarters.  The stories I had heard over the years about the county jail bounced around in my head like a pinball.  It was my second arrest as a young adult and by far the most serious in my short career as a hustler.  The days of going to the precinct or youth home, only to be let right back out, were over.  One month into my nineteenth birthday, I had officially graduated to the big leagues.  The consequences I faced were serious.  There would be no more slaps on the wrist or warnings from an irate judge.  There would be no bailouts from a counselor who could see my potential.  If I lost this one, it could possibly cost me the rest of my life in prison.  It was a sobering reality that my young mind wasn’t quite ready to accept.   I was snapped out of my thoughts by the sound of the bars rattling.  I removed the shirt that covered my head and looked up with a scowl on my face.  A light-skinned officer with a no-nonsense expression on his face stood at the cell bars.   “Get up and get dressed.  You’re being transferred to the county jail,” he barked, then turned and walked down the tier.  He repeated the same order to some other unfortunate souls.  I pulled myself up from the small, cramped bunk, slipped into my shoes and walked over to the bars.  I looked out onto the dusty tier as I put on the wrinkled shirt I had been wearing for the last three days.  My body and clothes smelled like I had been sleeping inside of a garbage dumpster behind one of Detroit’s famed Coney Island restaurants.   I rinsed my mouth and splashed my face with the tepid, rust-colored water that drizzled from the sink.  As I waited for the officer to return to my cell, my stomach fluttered like a charm of hummingbirds.  The clanging sounds of metal against metal rung out as cell doors were opened and banged shut.  A handful of inmates were herded down the tier and into a holding cell in preparation for the transfer to the county jail.   My heart began beating like a drum when the officer returned to get me.  I shuffled down the hallway slowly, barely holding my shorts up and doing my best not to lose my shoes.  They had taken my belt and shoe laces when I entered the precinct.  It was their way of making sure we didn’t hang ourselves or choke someone else.  When I reached the intake desk, they returned my shoelaces, belt, and the knot of money that I had in my pocket when they arrested me.  When I grabbed the thick wad of hundred and twenty dollar bills, a small current of excitement shot through my body.  The ill-gotten currency was a brief reminder of the city streets I had left behind.  But just as quickly as the excitement hit me, it disappeared as the thought that I might never see the streets of Detroit hit me with the force of an 18-wheeler Peterbilt truck.  I was stuffed into the bullpen where a dozen or so other inmates were waiting to go to the county jail.  Most of them were in their early- to mid-twenties, and from the looks on their faces, it was clear that they were thinking the same thing I was thinking despite their efforts to conceal it.  We all wanted to know how our lives had come to this and what lay ahead of us.  I flashed back to my childhood.  I thought about the first time my mother asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up.  I told her I wanted to be a doctor.  I wanted to help people recover from their illness and mend their broken bones.  I wanted to be the one to give children balloons and lollipops as my way of saying sorry for giving them shots.   The thoughts of me in a white lab coat with a stethoscope around my neck quickly faded to black as I returned my thoughts to the present.  I stood with my back against the wall, lost in thought about my current situation.  All I needed was one more shot at freedom and I would turn my life around, I thought to myself.  It wasn’t the first time I had told myself that.  There was the time I caught the felonious assault and drug possession case that led to me being sent to the Wayne County Youth Home.  I promised my father that I would turn my life around when I got out, and for a few months, I did okay.  I went off to Job Corps in Prestonburg, Kentucky, got my GED, and was doing well in my trade as a carpenter.  But I hadn’t completely relinquished my old ways.  The entire time I was at Job Corps, I was involved in every kind of illegal activity you could imagine.  I sold six-dollar joints and ran a loan-sharking ring, which culminated in me getting kicked out.  I was sent back home to Detroit on the next Greyhound, to my father’s great disappointment.  Then there was the case I had just beaten in Monroe County.  I was on my way back from one of my many trips to Ohio with a car full of cash and a trunk full of guns.  We were pulled over and arrested for receiving and concealing stolen property.  As I sat in the holding cell with my co-defendants, I told myself that was it.  I was tired of the streets and all that came with it.  At least that’s what I told myself as I sat in the cell sober, with plenty of time to think about my life.  On some levels, I was really tired, but not tired enough to completely leave the streets alone.  As soon as we beat the case and returned to the ‘hood, it was business as usual.  That was the routine I had established for myself.  As long as there was a threat to my freedom, I acted like I was ready to change.  It wasn’t until nearly a decade later that I would understand the work it requires to turn a life around.  Real change comes only at that point in which you are completely and thoroughly disgusted with your actions and the consequences they produce.  As the Honorable Elijah Muhammad once said, “One hundred percent dissatisfaction brings about one hundred percent change.”  In 1991, I was only about forty percent dissatisfied, so I continued to do the same thing as soon as the opportunity presented itself. I was a bullshit artist par excellence.  It was easy for me to fool people into thinking I was going to turn my life around, even myself.  We all knew that I had the potential and the intelligence to do anything I put my mind to, but it wasn’t until years later that I realized I had to truly desire change in my life if I wanted to change.  Back then, I wasn’t ready or willing to do the work necessary to turn my life around.   \tI loved living in the streets.  I loved the fast money, fast cars and fast women.  Above all that, I loved the reputation I had earned in the ‘hood.  I was known as a crazy motherfucker who wouldn’t hesitate to shoot anyone I felt posed a threat to me and my crew.  It was the one thing that made me feel like I was somebody.  It gave me a false sense of power, and what I felt was control, over my life.  When I drove or walked around the ‘hood, people acknowledged me out of fear or respect and that was the greatest feeling in the world to me at the time.  When I look back, it is really sad to see how insecure I was.  I didn’t like or respect myself, and I sought validation from people who were just as insecure and distorted in their thinking as I was.  It is this vicious cycle that gave birth to my hyper-violent behavior.  As noted Black psychologist Amos Wilson argued, the young Black male has perfected the art of being the best at being the worse, and that was me; I was becoming one of the best at being the worst predators in our community.  \tI was pulled out of my train of thought by the feeling that I was being watched.  When I looked up, I noticed a tall, slim guy staring at me.  I returned his glare before I walked over to him and asked him why he was staring at me. The way I saw it, if there was going to be a problem, I may as well get it out of the way; I didn’t want to spend the rest of my day worrying about whether there was going to be a problem between us.  It was one of those unwritten laws of the ‘hood, jail and prison yard.  When you encountered another male and you exchanged glances, you had to be up to the challenge or you would be considered weak.  In our world, being weak meant being preyed upon, and I wasn’t about to be anyone’s prey. \tA smile creased his face as he told me he remembered me from over on a street named Savannah, which was on the city’s eastside.  It was a street my sister had lived on back in the day.  Listening to him speak, I realized that he was a guy named Jimmy who lived around the corner from my sister.  I barely recognized him because he had grown several inches since the last time I had seen him, which was when we were about 13 or 14.  We kicked it about the old neighborhood for a minute before I asked him what he was being charged with.  He told me he had been charged with armed robbery and felony firearm, and before I could tell him what I had been charged with, he began telling me what he had overheard the officers talking about regarding my charges.  Apparently, they were disturbed by the violent act that I had committed at such a young age.  Back then, I didn’t realize that some of the officers had sons my age.  Understanding the statistics for young, Black males, they saw their sons in my face.  \tI was so disconnected from my humanity that I didn’t possess the ability to feel sorry for myself.  A few of the older brothers who were standing nearby gathered around as they overheard snippets of our conversation.  They were intrigued by my youthfulness and the callous manner in which I discussed how I was going to beat a murder rap.  It was youthful ignorance and arrogance.  The gravity of my situation hadn’t fully sunk in.  I was in survival mode and all that mattered to me was getting back out.  That’s how it always worked in my distorted world.   In a psychologically twisted way, I felt like a celebrity.  This pathological thinking is common among Black and Latino males.  These are the young brothers who have been marginalized because of their race and lack of education.  These are the young males who hang out in front of liquor stores and Bodegas with their version of the American dream stashed in plastic bags that they’ve stuffed in their boxers alongside the semi-automatic tools of freedom snuggly tucked in their waistbands.  In the ‘hood, the villain is the hero and someone that others look up to.   It wasn’t until nearly a decade later that I would come face-to-face with the truth.  Like many young brothers, I was suffering from an untreated mental illness as a result of being shot.  I had been living with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  What’s more disturbing is that people in the ‘hood idolized guys like me.  They knew I would go to any extreme to prove myself and make sure that my reputation as a “crazy nigga” remained intact.  Sadly, it is this mentality that has our community drowning in the murk and mire of gun violence and other self-destructive behavior.   \tI continued to talk with Jimmy about the old days until two deputies came and got us.  We were herded into a white Wayne County Sherriff’s van with a gold and brown badge on the side.  Most of us grew quiet as we sat lost in our own thoughts, our heads hung low like a sapling branch covered with the ice. \tThe ride was relatively short and uneventful.  With the exception of one annoying inmate who had obviously made the trip several times, everyone was quiet.  For some odd reason, he felt compelled to give us a dissertation on his trips to prison.  In every prison or jail I’ve been in, there was always that one loquacious person that annoyed everyone.  Amidst the soundtrack of his grating voice, the Wayne County Jail emerged.  The towering building that sat on St. Antoine didn’t look as imposing as the super-sized stories of violence and pain that were associated with it.  As we exited the van, I could feel the nervous energy that passed from one inmate to another as we stole glances at each other.   \tWe all wore the same stoic masks that we had worn standing on the corners in our respective ‘hoods.  From the violence-filled streets of Detroit to the organized crime families of Chicago, from the dirty South to the gang-infested streets of L.A. and the five boroughs of New York City, we all wear the masks.  It is the mask that far too many young, Black males are forced to wear at far too early an age.  It is the mask that says, “I am fearless, I don’t care, and I will destroy anything in my path, including myself.”  But all of us know that just beneath the surface exists an uncovered truth.  Indeed, beneath this mask of ‘hood savvy and toughness exists a small, vulnerable young boy whose heart has been turned cold by the emotional neglect and physical violence of his daily existence.  Earth, Wind and Fire wrote about it in a song, “A child is born with a heart of gold, ways of the world make his heart turn cold.”  That was us, a huddled crowd of scared little boys forced to act like street-wisened, hard-hearted veterans in an urban war movie.  Sadly for us, there would be no Academy Awards or Emmys to place on our mantels, only dark and lonely prison cells and freshly dug graves.  Despite this morbid reality, I vowed to play my role until the end credits rolled.   Once we enter the building, we are hustled through the bowels of the jail over to another bullpen where processing was underway.   \tThe nauseating smell of spoiled ass, super-funky armpits, and crusty toes that had been stuffed inside of musty socks for days punched me in the nose as soon as I stepped into the cramped bullpen.  The antiquated central air system did nothing to alleviate the stench, which made my eyes water.  As I entered, I scanned the room, observing the rest of the lost souls that were waiting to be processed into the county jail.  The hodge-podge of inmates was from all walks of life.  There were the veterans of lockdown who had grown accustomed to the dehumanizing existence of jail.  There were a few heroin addicts bestrewn across the hardwood benches and urine- and spit-soaked floors.  They lay curled in a fetal position, shaking like scared puppies as they fought the pain of withdrawal.  Then there were a few young brothers like myself who were experiencing the criminal version of the major leagues for the first time.  \tEvery ten minutes or so the deputy sheriffs would call about five to ten names.  When our name was called, we were ordered into a room where we were dressed out.  We exchanged our street clothes for the drab, vomit green county jail uniforms.  I leaned against the wall in the back of the bullpen and listened to the various war stories being exchanged between other inmates.  In each story, the storyteller was the hero.  This is one of the things I find disturbing to this day when I think about prison culture.  Most guys are slow to expose their vulnerabilities.  No one wants to admit they’re a drug addict or victim of violence, but everyone is quick to say they were drug lords and perpetrators of violence.  Over the years, I have discovered that in ninety percent of the cases, guys are a mixture of both.  If more would only admit this, real healing in our community would begin; however, as long as we continue to lie to ourselves and glorify pathological behavior, we will continue to suffer.  Despite this, I do recognize why so many use embellished storytelling as a coping tool.   \tBeing in prison and stripped of your freedom is a very painful and degrading experience.  Every day in there was a fight to maintain my sanity.  In order to escape from that brutal reality, there are inmates who will make up a whole different life.  They will say anything in order to be seen as different or above the rest of us poor, wretched souls.  There are some who are so good at lying, they no longer know where reality begins and fantasy ends.  Some are so outrageous in their storytelling that everyone knows they are lying, but because they are such artful storytellers, we sit around and listen to them anyway.  Then there are those who have perfected the art of lying to the point that they could probably convince former President G.W. Bush that he was Black and he only made it through college because of Affirmative Action.   \tAs I sat listening to their tales, I started thinking about what I would rather be doing.  In that very moment, I would have traded anything to be back in the ‘hood hustling and drinking with my homeboys.  My nostalgic longings were interrupted by the sound of my name being called along with a few more inmates.  It was our turn to get dressed out in Wayne County’s finest.  We stepped into the hallway and followed the deputy around the corner to the dressout room.  A few inmates from the last group were just slipping into their county greens when we entered the room, which smelled like an ass had just exploded.  The stench nearly caused me to buckle as I did my best to hold my breath.   We were all placed in line and told to strip.  As we removed our clothing, we were ordered to hand them to the deputies one article at a time.  They shook each item out methodically as they searched for contraband.  This lengthy search would be the first in a long line of humiliating experiences I would be subjected to.   \tOnce we were stripped of our personal clothing, we were ordered to raise our hands above our heads, lift up our nut sack, then turn around and spread our ass cheeks.  It was then that I understood why the room smelled as if an ass had exploded.  That room must have been subject to millions of unwashed assholes over the years, and I’m not speaking of the foul officers.  As I followed the instructions to lift my hands above my head and lift up my nut sack, I knew in my head that the first of my many troubles was about to begin.  At that point, I decided I was not going to spread my ass cheeks for anyone so I turned around and half-squatted down.  It was something I had learned in the youth home.  Most officers didn’t care to be looking up our rectum, but there was always one who seemed to take some type of sick pleasure in this dehumanizing act.  Squatting down was an unwritten compromise of sorts.  Fortunately, the deputy shaking me down didn’t seem to care.  When I turned back around, he asked me what size I wore, handed me my county greens and returned my underwear and socks.  Underwear and socks were the only personal clothing items we were allowed to keep.  I felt real trifling putting back on a pair of dirty socks and drawers that I had been wearing for the last few days.  It was a harsh reminder of how much of my life I had forfeited.  Little did I know, the chipping away at my humanity had just begun.  Like Dante journeying through the inferno, my life would forever be altered by the abuses, violence, and desperation that characterize prison life – oppressed against oppressor, predator against prey, the insane against the criminally insane, and the hopeful against the hopeless.   The sound of the steel doors banging shut was a sign that the iron monster had once again been fed, and thus my journey began. Chapter 3 \t “Come up off all that shit, lil’ nigga!” Tiny said desperately as he held the nickel-plated pistol to my head.   \tMy heart fluttered erratically like the broken wings of a baby bird.  I was terrified.  The cold, steel barrel pressing into my juvenile flesh pressed into my consciousness a colder reality – I could die at fourteen.  The toxic stench of the streets poured from Tiny’s body mingled with the sickly sweet smell of Wild Irish Rose.  I struggled to breathe as Tone, Tiny’s partner-in-crime, wrapped his crusty arm around my neck.  The dirt beneath his chipped fingernails and the scars where abscesses had attempted to heal imbedded themselves in my mind. Tiny gripped the gun with his right hand, which was bloated with open sores containing pools of festering, greenish-brown pus.  He was a heroin addict and a crack fiend, one of the worst combinations in a stick-up man.   \tIt was known in the streets that dope fiends wouldn’t hesitate to kill in order to get their next fix.  Adding crack to the mixture gave birth to the super-predators that roamed inner city jungles.  The fact that I was young enough to be their son didn’t matter to them.  All they cared about were the small, white crack rocks that were concealed in my underwear.  It was like the late-great rapper Notorious B.I.G. once said in a song, “Don’t you know niggas will kidnap kids, fuck ‘em in the ass, throw ‘em over the bridge.  That’s how it is.”  This characterized the streets of Detroit during the apex of the crack epidemic.  Murdering a child would have been all in a day’s work if that’s what it took for them to feed their addiction. \tIn my short career as a drug dealer, I had made several crucial mistakes that nearly cost me my life.  For one, I had trusted someone who was one of many victims of the most potently addictive drug at the time.  I hadn’t paid attention to my gut instinct, which whispered danger, danger, danger.  I had allowed Tiny and Tone to see too much, and now I was at their mercy.  I was too numb with fear to scream or plead for my life.   When the initial shock passed, I went into survival mode.  I retrieved the plastic bag from my underwear and handed it over to Tiny.  He then reached into one of my pocket and retrieved a small knot of cash, nearly ripping my pocket off in the process.  He stuffed the crack and money into his pocket and gave Tone the signal to let me go.  I knew in that moment that they were going to shoot me and push me down the basement steps where a tenant would find my decomposed body days later when the smell became to strong to ignore.  Instead, he pushed me toward the door of the building, prodding me forward with the pistol.   \t“Get your punk ass away from here,” Tiny ordered as he shoved me out of the door onto the cracked sidewalk on Chalmers.   \tA flood of emotions overtook me.  I was relieved that they hadn’t killed me.  My thin, teenaged body trembled with fear as I walked to the Coney Island that sat on the corner of Chalmers and Jefferson.  I was a bit disoriented and unclear about what to do.  When I stepped into the Coney Island, I felt like everyone inside knew what had just happened to me.  I looked from one unfriendly face to the next, hoping that someone would see the fragile child I was.  Instead, all they saw was a designer-clad youth trying to be grown before his time.  As I look back, I wonder if what I had interpreted as angry glares were really puzzled faces wondering why I didn’t have my ass in school with the rest of the children my age.  \tI calmed down, then turned and walked out of the restaurant.  As I walked, a deep feeling of shame and loneliness overcame me. When I walked into the restaurant, I wanted someone to rescue me from the streets.  I wanted someone to see a lovable, smart little boy who was hurting inside.  I wanted to cry out, but I knew I couldn’t because I had made a promise to never allow anyone to make me cry or see me cry again.  Deep down, I was ashamed of feeling afraid.  I was supposed to be brave and ready to die, but the truth was, I wasn’t. \tI walked a couple of blocks before I came to a phone booth on Kercherval.  By the time I dialed my boss’s pager number, anger was the only emotion I was feeling, or at least that’s how I acted.  There was no way I was going to tell Miko that I was scared.  I couldn’t let anyone in our crew know that the prospect of dying in a urine-soaked hallway didn’t appeal to my young mind.  See, death wasn’t something I had bargained for when I decided to sell dope.  I thought about the money I would make to buy the clothes that I wanted.  I thought about being able to buy a Honda Elite 150.  I thought about being able to buy happiness, love and a safe place to lay my head.  I hadn’t given any serious thought to the fact that I could possibly forfeit my freedom or life over a bag of rocks that were only worth a thousand dollars.  Sadly, this is a reality that exists to this day.  Young brothers and sisters are willing to risk their lives in a neverending quest for the ghetto dream.   \tMiko returned my call and told me to meet him back at the spot on Marlborough and Jefferson.  I walked the short distance back to the large, white house that I had been lured out of.  The paint was peeling and the roof sagged as though it was ready cave in.  The front door was ajar and the smell of decay poured out of every crack.  The inside of the house made me uncomfortable, which made it easy for me to leave when Larry told me that he had a better spot around the corner on Chalmers.  I had served Larry a few times and he appeared cool, so when he offered his apartment as a new spot to roll from, I didn’t hesitate.  Adding to the allure of a new spot was the fact that the spot on Marlborough was hot as hell.  The narcotics unit boldly parked a couple of houses down almost every day, and sometimes they pulled directly in front of the spot.  It was one of the many reasons I had never liked the Marlborough spot.  That and the fact that it was unfit for human habitation.   \tThe bathtub was full of shit, piss and dirty clothes.  The toilet overflowed with wrappers from the nearby Coney Island and roaches crawled across the floors and walls in droves.  The smell of cheap insecticide mixed with the unmistakable smell of human despair.  The whole scene was depressing and the thick aroma made me nauseous.  In many ways, the house on Marlborough reflected the mentality of the people in the streets.  Little did I know, this same sickness was soaking into my pores.   I was on edge as I sat on the porch waiting for Miko to arrive.  The rustling of garbage in the overgrown grass lot next door caused me to jump nervously.  I turned around quickly, only to find a stray mutt foraging through the garbage looking for something to eat.  I calmed my nerves as a deep burning began to simmer inside of me.  I reflected back to the day that I left my mother’s house and the events that led to the dissolution of our family.  My heart throbbed with a longing for things that used to be.   My parents’ marriage deteriorated in stages like an arthritic knee.  Piece by piece, things fell apart.  And that’s what made their divorce so hard for me to accept.  They would separate and then get back together, giving me a glimmer of hope that things would go back to how they used to be.  But that day never came.  Instead, over the course of a five-year period, our family experienced the valleys and peaks of a young couple trying to keep their family together while battling external factors that slowly pulled them apart.  \tI remember the first time my parents separated.  They called us into the kitchen in our nicely kept, brick home on Detroit’s east side.  I knew something was amiss, but my 11-year-old mind was not prepared for the devastating news that would come.   My parents argued like I imagine any other couple did, but they never berated each other and they never physically fought. So when they announced that they were separating, it shocked us into silence.  \t“You know things haven’t been going that good between me and your father,” I recall my mother saying. “So we have decided it’s best for us to separate,” she continued, her voice cracking as she spoke.   \tI looked at my father for an answer.  The corner of his mouth trembled and his eyes watered as he began speaking. \t“Even though things aren’t working out between me and your mother, I will always be y’all father,” he said as he fought back tears.   \tI was lost.  I didn’t understand what they were talking about.  Did separation mean he would be sleeping on the couch like he did sometimes after they argued?  Did it mean he would go and spend a couple of nights at his best friend Clark’s house?  Or would he come and live upstairs with us?  Never did I consider the alternative – my father living in a house separate from us.  When he finally explained that he would be moving to Highland Park that coming weekend, my once cozy home existence became alarmingly frightful.  All kinds of thoughts about what my father meant to our household began flowing through my young mind.  I thought about the holidays and how he would organize my siblings and me so that we could put up the Christmas tree.  I thought about him giving us an allowance every other Saturday morning so that we could go skating at Royal Skateland.  I thought about the sound of him pulling into the driveway each night at approximately 11:45p.m. when he got off of work.   It was as though everything that symbolized family stability had been sucked out of the room by their news.  As they went on to explain that my father would live in the first floor flat of a duplex on Pasadena, my young heart went numb.  I listened as my mother explained to me and my three sisters that we would spend the summer, winter break, holiday vacations and weekends at my father’s, and we would go to school from her house.  In my mind, that’s just what our once happy home on Camden became – her house.  Without my father and her husband residing with us full-time, her house could never be the warm, loving home we once shared as a family.   I tried to process all they had shared with us as my father called me to join him in the basement.  I slunk down the stairs trying to be brave and strong because he told me that I would be the man of the house.  It was hard for me to accept his words considering my puny chest and string bean arms, but I made a silent vow not to let my father down.  As I descended the stairs and entered the first room of our basement, I started having flashbacks of how our home had developed over the years.  I remembered watching my father and uncles hang paneling on the walls while my mother and aunts painted each room, the sounds of Parliament blaring throughout the house.  Our home was family central and every one of my aunts, uncles and cousins had lived with us at some point.  But after that fateful day, our family would never be the same again.  \tWhen we began packing, my father outlined what my responsibilities would be now that he was leaving.  He told me that I would have to cut the grass and wash the car for my mother.  He told me that I was responsible for my two younger sisters who were 3 and 8 at the time, and that I had to maintain my honor roll status at school.  He continued to talk as we packed some of his albums in orange and blue milk crates.  The images of each album cover conjured up visions of the house parties that my parents had thrown in our basement.  As he rifled through the albums by The Isley Brothers, The Ohio Players, The O’Jay’s and Marvin Gaye, I took in the Afros, platform shoes, and scantily clad women.  I thought about my uncle John rousing me from my sleep so that I could come and dance to the sounds of ‘70s funk as my aunts and uncles cheered me on.  The taste of Schlitz Malt Liquor came creeping back as I thought about my uncle Chris or uncle Keith sneaking me a lil’ sip to ensure that I went right back to sleep when the dancing was over.   I looked at my father as he stared at one of his many albums, and I could sense that he was experiencing the same feeling I was.  When he looked up at me, his eyes were red and the tears began flowing freely.  He hugged me tight and cried from deep within.  His scruffy beard scratched my face and the smell of his cologne drifted up my nose as his body heaved with the pain of seeing his family torn apart.  In an instant, we were both crying and hugging each other.  Thinking back, my father’s tears are the best gifts he’s ever given me.  He showed me that real men cry, especially when they love deeply, and there is no deeper love than the love that my father has for his family.  We packed and cried, and packed and cried until we finally began laughing and joking with each other.  When we were done in the basement, he assured me that he would always be there for me no matter what, and to this day, he has never let me down.   \tOver the course of the weekend, we moved my father’s belongings to his new home on Pasadena Street in Highland Park.  Little did I know, that weekend would mark the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster ride for our family.  After being separated for a little over a year, my parents got back together.  Their reconciliation lasted for a short period before they separated for the second time a couple years later.  \tWhen my parents decided to get back together, I was overjoyed.  I imagined our family coming back together and things returning to normal, but it wasn’t long before my quixotic notions were shattered.  After a few months, I noticed my father sleeping on the couch.  My parents would go days without speaking to each other and the tender kisses and affection that they once displayed were replaced with empty stares.  My nights became restless as I stayed awake late into the night waiting for my father to come home from work.  I would listen intently when he entered the house, and sometimes I would crawl from my bedroom into the hallway and peak down the stairs into our living room.  I held my breath hoping that instead of seeing my father asleep on the couch, the couch would be empty.  But night after night, I was disappointed when I saw him curled up in a ball on the couch.  In my mind, I knew it was only a matter of time before they would be breaking the bad news.  \tI felt betrayed by my parents.  I wanted them to stay together forever.  I didn’t want my mother to love another man, and I didn’t want my father to love another woman.  I learned to distrust them on the days that things were going smoothly between them.  Every time I thought things were returning to normal, I was dealt a blow by my father’s presence on the couch.  Finally, the day came when they decided to separate for the second time.  It had been nearly two years since the first split.  I had seen all of the signs, but a part of me was still in denial until my mother called me into the house to break the news. \tI was a few houses down the block playing touch football in the middle of the street with my childhood friends when my mother stepped onto our front porch and called my name.  I took a two-step dropback and hurled the ball into the air as I yelled out Terry Bradshaw.  I watched in awe as the ball spiraled down into the outstretched hands on my best friend Steve.  He cradled the cracked, leather hide to his chest, ignoring the stinging in his hands as he hollered out Lynn Swann and slammed the ball into the ground.  Like other kids on the playground, we always summoned the names of the greats in hopes that it would make us better.  We were innocent and still held dreams of making or throwing the game-winning touchdown in the Super Bowl.  In our eyes, we were destined for greatness.  \tI walked the short distance to my house, sulking a bit at having my football game interrupted.  How was I ever going to make it to the NFL if she kept breaking up my games to have me run errands?  Didn’t she realize I needed to practice?  These were the questions that danced through my little head as I climbed the porch stairs.  Then, a little smile crept across my face when I realized that she had seen me throw a perfect spiral. \tWhen I entered the house, my mother was on her way upstairs where my bedroom was located.  My focus then shifted from my football exploits to my mother’s movements.  Maybe I was in trouble for leaving my room in a mess, or maybe the bathroom I shared with my sisters wasn’t cleaned to her liking.  \tHer voice cascaded down the stairs in a gentle stream as she called my named again.  I immediately sensed something was wrong.  The melodious voice that she used was usually reserved for special occasions like when I brought home a good report card or during a holiday celebration when we had a house full of company.  \tWhen I reached my room, she was standing with her back to me, looking at the walls where pictures of my sports heroes and dream cars were taped haphazardly.  For the briefest moment, I thought she was about to tell me to dismantle my fiscally responsible interior decorations.  I couldn’t bear the thought of having to remove my posters of Tony Dorsett or the ‘69 Cutlass 442 that I was deeply in love with.  When she turned to face me, tears clung to the corners of her eyes like little diamonds.  She pulled me close to her, embracing me in a warm hug, and then inhaled deeply before she began speaking.   “Pumpkin,” she said, using the nickname that my Aunt Bebe had given me.  “I want you to know I will always love you no matter what happens.  As you know, me and your father have been going through some problems and we have decided it’s best for us to separate again,” she said before pausing.   As her words barreled into my ears, my heart began crumbling into pieces like stale crackers.  I didn’t want to believe that they were separating again.  They promised us that they had fixed things.  Although I didn’t want her words to be true, the signs were obvious.  I nodded my pumpkin head letting her know that I understood. As she continued speaking, I could see her inner turmoil.  Her words cartwheeled around inside of her mouth before leaping out.  Each word attacked me in a flurry, hitting me indiscriminately.  I stumbled around in an emotional fog, grasping for something to hold onto, but her words staggered me like a punch from Mike Tyson.   “You will have to move in with your father this time.  I can no longer raise you.  You are a young man now and you will be better off living with your father,” she explained before suddenly turning away from me.  Her words shredded my heart like a cheese grater.  I didn’t have a problem living with my father.  The problem was the deep feeling of rejection that I felt.  How could a mother give up her child?  What was wrong with me to make her not want to keep me?  Was I a bad person?  Why was I the only one going away?  Who would love me like only a mother could?  In that moment, I began erecting an emotional wall that I felt would protect me from my parents and any other intruder.  I was tired of being hurt and confused by two people who I loved more than anyone.   Soon after, my relationship with my mother became very antagonistic and a chasm slowly developed between us.  By the time my parents reconciled for the second time a year later, our disconnect was evident.  When my father and I moved back home, there was a great deal of tension between my mother and me.  We clashed over any and every thing.  I had grown accustomed to the liberal way that my father raised me, and at the age of 14, I was not ready to conform to her strict rules.  I had begun smoking cigarettes and had taken a keen interest in girls.  I was used to being on my own and doing what I wanted to do because my father worked all day.  I had had a taste of what it felt like to be an only child and no longer wanted to share with my younger sisters or spend much time with them.   I resented my sisters because I felt like my mother had chosen them over me.  I also resented my mother because I felt like she was rejecting me.  Every chance I got, I defied her authority.  My father tried to rein me in and support her in her efforts to bring me under control, but it was too late.  I had developed an “I don’t give a fuck attitude.”  Little did I know, it was a protective shell that a lot of Black males wear.  The way I saw it, if I don’t care about anything, nothing can hurt me.   My mother responded to my recalcitrant behavior by physically beating me.  It wasn’t long before I reached my breaking point.  At 14, I felt I was too old to accept another ass whooping, and having grown physically stronger, I knew it was time for me to leave before I reacted to her physical assaults. She reminded me often that I could leave if I didn’t want to abide by her rules, so I said fuck it and left.   Deep inside, I wanted her to stay up worrying about me like mothers do.  I wanted her to search for me with tears in her eyes.  I wanted her to be concerned about my safety and well-being.  I wanted her to hurt the way that I hurt.  But more than anything, I wanted to be validated by her love.  That never happened, so I turned to the streets for love.  I lived the life of a transient for two weeks.  I slept and ate in the basements and garages of my childhood friends Tommie Seymour and Ernie.  They did their best to conceal me and help me out, but they were only able to hide me for so long before their parents were on to us.  One day while deciding what my next move would be, an older guy from the neighborhood came riding down the street.  He stopped and asked us if we knew anyone willing to work in one of his drug houses.  After listening to his sales pitch, which included a place to lay my head and money to buy food, I took him up on his offer.  I didn’t know what I was getting myself into, and it wasn’t long before I realized that I was in way over my head.   Chapter 4 \t “I thought you were getting transferred back upstate,” I heard a voice call out from the dayroom as my cell door slid open.   \t“They canceled the transfer,” my bunky said over his shoulder as he entered the small, cramped cell.   I watched him as he reorganized his toiletries and commissary on the metal desk that was attached to the back wall of the cell.   “Man, you ain’t gonna believe this shit,” he turned to me as he handrolled a cigarette. \t“What happened?” I asked, leaned up against the wall watching his methodical movements. \t“This nigga in the bullpen raped a white boy this morning,” he said with a puzzled expression on his face.  It was as though he was still trying to make sense of what he had witnessed.   “Who got raped?” Satan asked as he approached our cell door.  “Come on, I’ll tell y’all what went down,” my bunky replied as he exited the cell.  He lit up a cigarette and sat on the table in front of our cell.  He inhaled deeply, sucking in the bitter smoke of the cigarette, then exhaled as though he was forcing the painful memory up from his lungs along with the acrid smoke.  “This morning when we went down to the bullpen to transfer, this nigga named Seven gave this white boy his cereal and donut.  We didn’t think nothing of it until we seen him talking to him in the back of the bullpen,” he explained as he took another drag of his cigarette. “What happened, dog?” a guy named Twin said as he walked up. “Nigga got fucked in the butt in the bullpen,” someone said, causing a trickle of nervous laughter to travel around the room.  It was the first time many of us had come face-to-face with one of the most brutal and violent aspects of prison life.  I could sense that the men in the room were asking themselves questions.  Some wondered if they would ever be the victim of such a vicious attack on their manhood.  Others questioned whether they would ever become so sexually desperate that they’d resort to raping another man.  Still others wondered what they would do if they were a witness to such an attack.  Before we could fully process the questions in our heads, my bunky continued, “First, the nigga Seven asked the white boy how he was going to pay him back for the cereal and donut he had eaten.  The white boy told him he thought he had given him the food because he wasn’t hungry and couldn’t take it with him.  He said it half-jokingly, which seemed to give Seven some kind of sick thrill.  He moved in close to the white boy massaging his dick, and then told him he knew how he could repay him.”  I could see my bunky struggling with the image in his head as he continued telling us what happened.  “A few cats started making jokes about how nothing in prison was free.  I don’t think they realized how serious Seven was until he put the white boy in a choke hold,” he recounted as he took the last puff of his cigarette, then thumped the butt across the dayroom.  The butt hit the wall and caused sparks to fly before it landed in a pool of fetid water by the shower.  “He choked the white boy for about a minute before his face started turning blue, then he passed out.  I never thought he would take it further than that,” he said with a distant look in his eyes. “But he wasn’t finished.  It looked like he had snapped.  He dropped the white boy on the floor, and then rolled him onto his stomach.  He pulled the white boy’s pants down, spread his ass cheeks apart and spit in his ass.  He didn’t give a fuck that we were all sitting there.  He pulled his pants down and started fucking the guy in his ass like he was with a woman,” he continued as he shook his head. “That’s fucked up,” Satan said.  “Did the white guy wake up?” Twin asked. “Yeah, he woke up while that nigga was fucking him and started screaming.  That shit made the nigga Seven go crazy and he started fucking him harder until the deputies rushed to the bullpen to see what was going on.” “Why y’all ain’t stop the nigga?” someone asked.  “What the fuck you mean, why we didn’t stop him?  Nigga, you know the rules to this shit,” my bunky responded angrily. “Yeah fool, you know the rules to this shit.  Mind your motherfuckingn business,” Satan said in defense of my bunky. “What the deputies do to Seven?”  “I think they were just as shocked as we were.  They couldn’t believe he was raping the guy in front of us like there was nothing wrong with what he was doing.  And the worst part of it all is the white boy was only going to boot camp.” “That’s fucked up,” Twin said.  “He should sue these slimy motherfuckers for putting him in the bullpen with that crazy nigga in the first place.” “I don’t know if he’ll get any money, but he should.  The deputies didn’t really do shit but tell Seven to let him up.  When he was finished, he got up laughing as he pulled up his pants.  The white boy laid in the middle of the floor crying until someone helped him up.  They put Seven in a bullpen by himself, and they took the white boy to the hospital,” my bunky replied before lighting up another cigarette.  I listened for a little bit longer before I returned to my cell to think about all he had shared and the response of the other men.  I had only been in the county jail for two weeks and had learned a great deal about jail and prison life.  I thought about what it would feel like to live the rest of my life around men who were capable of raping and killing another human over something as insignificant as a bowl of cereal or a cigarette.  I thought about the human breaking point, the fragmenting of the human psyche.  What kind of mental pressure would it take for me to become a complete savage capable of the most reprehensible acts of violence and depravity? In that very moment, I promised myself I would not leave prison worse than I entered.  I understood the serious nature of my crime; however, I knew there were some things I would never be capable of, and raping another human being was one of them.  Nor would I ever become a snitch in order to get out of prison early.  I was a firm believer that a man must step up and accept the consequences of the decisions he makes.  Sadly, I would soon learn that not many had the same philosophy when it came to doing time. During the first two weeks of my stay in the county jail, I got an uncensored glimpse into prison and jail culture.  This was not MSNBC Lockdown, however.  This was real life.  There was a clear pecking order and the laws of the jungle governed all behavior from staff to inmates.  It was truly survival of the fittest.  As I stepped through the sliding glass doors onto 6 NW, the room grew silent.  The only sound I could hear was the drone of the raggedy television that sat atop a metal table.  The door groaned as it closed, banging shut with the same finality as a judge’s gavel.  I scanned the room, taking stock of the black and brown faces that were present.  I processed each face rapidly like a computer on steroids.  I was on the lookout for any potential enemies from the streets or familiar faces from the ‘hood.  I was hoping for the latter and felt a sense of trepidation about the former. I proceeded to my cell after taking stock of the room and concluded that there was no one there I knew.  I could feel the heat from the unfamiliar eyes that bore into me.  Out of my peripheral, I saw a bald-headed, dark-skinned inmate talking to a brown-skinned inmate with a long scar on his face.  They whispered to each other as they watched me.  My street senses kicked in and I knew immediately that if I were going to have a problem, it would originate with them.  It was clear from how the other inmates reacted to them that they were at the top of the food chain, and I could sense the rest of the guys in the room waiting to see what they would do.  This behavior was symptomatic of guys who where used to following instead of leading and was a constant in jails, prisons and on the streets.  Very few of the men I have encountered over the years have the courage to stand on their own.   I knew I was being sized up from the moment I stepped onto the rock.  It was evident from the inmates’ behavior that they were waiting to see what the Alpha males would do in response to my presence.  I returned their glares, sending a clear message that I wouldn’t hesitate to fight to the death if need be, but I didn’t allow my stare to linger.  It was my way of letting them know that I wasn’t a shit starter either.  It was one of the many rules of human engagement that I had learned on the streets of Detroit where staring at someone could get you shot or killed.  It was important to let people know that you weren’t a pushover, but equally important to let them know that you weren’t trying to punk them either.  It was a delicate balance of life and death in an environment where getting killed over stepping on someone’s shoe was a far too common occurrence.  Unfortunately for us, prisons and jails have become an extension of the ‘hood.  Due to the growing rate of incarceration, the streets and prisons were now interchangeable, including the laws that governed both.  I entered the cell I was assigned to and tossed my bedroll on the top bunk before checking out the cell.  The only thing that I wanted more than my freedom was sleep and a hot shower.  I looked around the cell and my heart started beating rapidly.  It felt like the walls were closing in on me.  I couldn’t believe that my life had been reduced to a two-man cell with a toilet in it.  I knew in that moment as I looked at the metal toilet that I was going to figure out how to escape as soon as I could.  My train of thought was interrupted by the cell door opening up.   I could feel my anger beginning to rise as the dark-skinned, bald-headed guy approached the door.  I clenched my fist tightly and prepared to deliver the first blow as soon as he got into arm’s reach.  I had heard enough about the county jail to know that the guys on the tier would beat your ass for recreation if there was something they didn’t like about you, and from the whispers that were exchanged, I figured there was something about me that they didn’t like.   I didn’t know how I would fair against a multi-pronged attack, but I knew I wasn’t going to be the only one hurting or bleeding.  I could feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins as the bald-headed guy stepped into the cell.  “You smoke?” he asked as he walked past me to the desk in the back of the cell.  “Yeah,” I said, a bit confused.  “You might want to roll one of these up before they lock us down for the night,” he replied, passing me a pack of Bugler brand, handrolled cigarettes as though it was the most natural thing in the world.  I took the pack without knowing what to do with it.  I had never rolled my own cigarettes, and up to that point, all I had smoked was Newports.  I looked at the pack and then back at him.  He rolled a thick wad of tobacco into the cigarette paper and left the cell.  I followed suit, but my rolling skills were unrefined so my cigarette came out looking like a lopsided joint.  I didn’t care though because all I could think about was the rush of nicotine that would satisfy my craving.   I stepped out on the rock and got a light from the automatic lighter attached to the wall.   I inhaled deeply and began choking immediately. The pungent smoke felt like it was ripping my throat to shreds as I sucked it deep into my lungs.  Everyone on the rock started laughing as they watched me struggle with the cigarette.  Despite being the worst taste I had experienced, I continued to smoke until I had satiated my nicotine appetite.  Moments later, a voice came over the PA system telling us that it was time for lockdown.  “They call me S,” my bunky said by way of introduction as we returned to the cell.   “Jay,” I replied with a nod.  “What they got you for,” he asked as he leaned back on his bunk.   “Open murder,” I said as I studied his face. “Damn homie, I hope you beat that motherfucker,” he said as he leaned forward.  I could see his mind working like the mechanism of a Rolex as he thought back to his own experience.  “They hit me on a murder and sentenced me to natural life,” he continued. “But I’m about to give this time back,” he continued with a confidence that made me believe him. At the time, I didn’t know the difference between natural life and a life sentence.  Nor did I have a clue about how the judicial system worked.  Natural life meant that my bunky would never be granted a parole, and if his sentence weren’t overturned, he would die in prison.  A life sentence meant that he could be paroled after serving twenty years.   We talked deep into the night about his case and prison.  He had been in prison for two years on his natural life sentence and was back on a writ fighting another case.  He told me what prison life was like and gave me some basic rules to apply in the event I came to prison.  He also told me that he thought I would beat my case.  I didn’t know what he was basing his opinion on, but in that moment, it was what I needed to hear.  It gave me hope, and at that time, hope was the one thing keeping me alive. It wouldn’t be until years later that I truly learned how important hope is for anyone going through a tough time in his or her life.  I washed my face and upper torso in the sink before hopping on the bunk.  I couldn’t wait for the morning so that I could take a shower and get something to eat in my system.  I laid back on the bunk and that’s when my worst enemy – my own thoughts – hit me in the head.  My whole life began running through my head in a stream of consciousness that flowed violently like the current of the Mississippi.  I thought about some of the things I hadn’t thought about for years.  I had to make some sense out of my situation. I couldn’t believe I was sitting in a cell with a stranger discussing the possibility of me spending the rest of my life in prison.   My reality didn’t feel real.  It felt like I was living in a twisted urban nightmare and I would wake up at any moment.  I had to wake up because my life wasn’t meant to turn out this way.  I was supposed to be on my way to college to follow my dream of becoming a doctor.  I was supposed to be a healer of the people, not a destroyer.  I shook my head from side to side in an effort to awaken.  I didn’t want to see what I had become, but my thoughts wouldn’t let me off the hook.  They continued to hit me like a flurry of quick jabs from Floyd Mayweather.  They punched indiscriminately; no area was off limits.   I laid up for hours thinking and thinking about what my life had become.  I thought about what I had done and what I had to do to make it right.  The hardest thoughts for me to deal with were the thoughts of my live-in girlfriend, Brenda.  A deep sadness engulfed me as I thought about the life growing inside of her womb.  I thought about the conversation we had the night before I was arrested.  I looked into her eyes and told her that everything would be alright, that we would get away from Detroit and get a fresh start with our unborn child.  We would give him or her the life that we dreamed of as children.  She laid her head on my chest and looked up at me with tear-filled eyes.  I rubbed her belly where our precious baby was growing and being nurtured.  “Can you feel it?” she asked as she guided my hand to the region of her stomach where our baby rested.  The warmth of her belly coupled with the warmth I felt in my heart made me believe everything would be alright, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. I thought about the embarrassment and disappointment my father was experiencing as he dealt with my arrest.  Up to that point, I hadn’t spoken with him, my stepmother or my mother.  I didn’t want to call them.  I had made a decision to live the street life and felt like I had to deal with the consequences of the decisions I made.  I had grown accustomed to dealing with people whose love was conditional, so I had no expectations for either of my parents to be there for me.  I realize now that I didn’t know the true meaning of love and had no idea what it meant to be a parent who was hurting because their child was hurting.  It wasn’t until years later that I would learn about the many sleepless and tearful nights that my father had as a result of my incarceration. The thoughts continued to flow like water.  I thought of all the betrayals I had experienced.  From being turned in by someone I thought was my best friend to having people I knew make statements against me.  I could feel a small ball of anger forming in the core of my soul.  Everyone I thought of as friends had turned their back on me.  I wasn’t gone a week and people had begun stealing my clothes and playing on my money.  The ultimate betrayal, however, and the hardest thing for me to deal with, was my own betrayal.  I had turned my back on myself the first time I picked up drugs, alcohol and guns.  I had given up on myself.  In fact, I had never even given myself a chance to succeed. I thought about every teacher and parent who had asked me why I was wasting my potential.  They believed in me more than I believed in myself.   The officers who arrested me also asked me why I was wasting my life.  I was intelligent, articulate, and capable of doing something meaningful with my life; but I chose to squander it.   It can’t end like this, I thought to myself as I drifted off to sleep.  I didn’t have any idea how I was going to write a different chapter, but one thing I was certain of, it wouldn’t end like this.  Over the span of a few weeks, I was given a crash course in jailing.  I learned everything about the barter system when it came to exchanging food or cigarettes for services like making phone calls or writing a letter for someone who couldn’t write.  I learned jail wasn’t that different from the streets; it was a power-based environment and the only thing that was respected was violence and money.  It was an unwritten rule that every inmate would have to prove himself at some point, and if you had money, you had to prove that you could keep it or find someone who had your back to be sure you could keep it.  The fact that I had been charged with murder was evidence to the other inmates that I was willing to defend myself.  Yet I knew there would come a time when I would have to prove without a doubt that I was a lion.  Once I was settled in, I got on the phone and called a lady named Georgia who lived down the street from me.  She was like a big sister and was real cool people.  She took my call and I could hear concern in her voice.  It was through her that I talked to all of the people that I needed to talk to.  She would make three-way calls and have people that I needed to talk to come by the house.  She was one of few people that I can say was truly a friend at a time when I needed a friend.  She never complained and did anything she could to help me out, something I have never forgotten.   The first day I called, she went and got Brenda for me.  When Brenda answered the phone, I could tell that she had been worried about me.  There was a child-like vulnerability in her voice that made me want to hug her.  I felt a surge of guilt shoot through my body that caused me to buckle.  I had never thought about the fact that by getting locked up, I was also imprisoning everyone who loved or cared about me.   For the first few minutes, Brenda and I talked about what was going on in the ‘hood.  We talked about my defense strategy and what I thought needed to be done in order for me to beat the case.  We also talked about some of the money issues that she was facing.  I gave her a few suggestions and told her that I would talk to a few people to help her out.  I gave her the date of my next court appearance, and before I could say anything else, she started crying. “My stomach is growing, and the baby is kicking,” she cried softly. “I’ll be home before the baby is born,” I responded in a whisper.  “I need you here with me right now,” she continued. “I know,” I said shamefully. “Why does God take everybody I love away from me?” she asked as she continued to cry. “I don’t know baby, but I’m coming home,” I said as I thought about getting out.  “You betta get your ass home,” she said with a smile in her voice that nearly melted my heart.   Brenda was a tough girl who grew up in tougher circumstances, yet she had the most beautiful laugh that I had ever known.  Even though we had been living together, we were still getting to know each other when I got arrested.  My feelings for her confused me because I had vowed to never fall in love with a woman; however, as I listened to her on the other end of the phone, I realized that I really loved and cared about her and there was no way I could leave her out there to fend for herself and our child.  She deserved to be taken care of, and she deserved to have the father of her child by her side to help raise him or her.  In that moment, I vowed I would get out or die trying.  I didn’t know how I was going to make it happen, but I knew that I would do whatever was in my power to get back to Brenda and our baby. When we got off of the phone, I was emotionally and mentally drained, and the last thing I wanted to do was talk to anyone on the rock.  I hung the phone up and was on my way back to my cell when a guy named Tiny commented on my phone call. “That nigga Jay just got off the phone sucker stroking,” he said with a laugh. A few guys laughed at his joke.  It was something guys said about guys who showed any emotions toward their girlfriends while they were on lockdown.  Openly showing your emotions on the streets was considered a weakness, so whenever someone showed any emotions toward a female, be it love or anger, they would say he was sucker stroking.  Twin’s statement was said in a joking manner, but I wasn’t in the mood for joking, so I checked him and set the stage for me to show and prove that I could handle my business. “Stay out my business, bitch ass nigga,” I said as I turned toward him.   “Damn, nigga. I was just bullshitting,” he responded as everyone grew silent. “You don’t know me like that to be playing, so stay the fuck out my business,” I continued as my anger began growing.  I could see that he was at a loss for words and I was a bit disappointed that he didn’t take the bait.  I was fighting mad, and because I had not learned a healthy way of processing my emotions, I was ready to let off some of my frustration with a good fight.   “Come on, homeboy, let that go,” an older cat named L said as he guided me towards my cell.  He was from the Cass Corridor and was one of the older guys on the rock.  All of the guys on the rock respected him and he was the go-to-guy for advice.  He would sit and talk to us about life, the Bible and prison.  He was very insightful, articulate, and genuine in his concern for us.  He had been to prison before and was a prisoner to his crack addiction.  Like many of the guys who come through the revolving doors of prison, he was at his best in an institutional setting where he was away from the temptation of drugs.   When we reached my cell, he came inside and asked me what was going on.  I gave him the rundown before a guy from Inkster named Gigolo joined us.  We sat around kicking it about life and the time we were facing.  Gigolo had just had a son before he got locked up and could relate to what I was going through.  My anger began subsiding as we smoked a few cigarettes and kicked it.  After about half an hour, Twin showed up at the door.  He apologized for his comments and I apologized for snapping on him.  We were all going through some tough times and trying to find ways to cope with our fucked up situation. After my dispute with Twin, guys on the rock started looking at me differently.  They often sought me out for advice and I slowly emerged as a leader on the rock.  At the age of 19, I was helping older inmates solve their problems, and they had no problem deferring to me.  L took this all in and gave me counsel along the way.  He later told me that I reminded him of himself when he was growing up.  He told me that he had always been smart, but could never pull himself away from the allure of the streets and drugs. Gigolo and me developed the strongest bond out of the young guys.  We were a lot alike, except Gigolo liked to fight far more than I did and that made a lot of the guys on the rock distance themselves from him.  For the most part, they were scared of him because he was unpredictable.  It didn’t take much for him to be provoked to fight.   I could sense that the other guys on the rock wanted to see me and Gigolo fight each other.  It all started on the basketball court.  Prior to my arrival on the rock, Gigolo was the man on the court, not because he was the best player, but because he was the most aggressive and volatile.  He would foul other players and intimidate them from coming to the hole.  On the flip side, they were afraid to play too physical with him because he was notorious for wanting to fight after he got fouled.  The first time we went to the gym, we were on opposite teams.  We were checking each other and there was a lot of shit talking coming from the sidelines.  The game was very competitive and we both played very aggressively.  The more intense the game got, the more the guys on the sidelines tried to incite us.  However, we both knew what was going on.  While we were both competitive and wanted to win, we never let it get out of control.  Once guys saw that we weren’t feeding into their bullshit, they sat back and enjoyed watching us go at it.  My team came out victorious, but our bond was the true victor.  We ended up being on the same squad the rest of the time I was there, and together, we basically ran the gym.   The way I competed against Gigolo on the court increased the respect I had amongst the other guys on the rock.  They gravitated to me even more.  Unlike Gigolo, I never tried to intimidate any of them; however, I always stood my ground no matter who I dealt with, something they all respected, including Gigolo.  As the weeks went on, the dynamics of our rock began changing as guys left and other guys arrived.   My bunky was finally sent back upstate and I got a new bunky who I didn’t talk to that often.  He was the complete opposite of all the guys I dealt with.  He was kind of feminine and too high maintenance.  He stayed in the cell drawing most of the day or reading.  In addition to my new bunky, there were a few more arrivals.  Another inmate named Butterball had come back on a writ.  He gravitated to us along with two cats named Jabo and G.  On a daily basis, we would sit in my cell or Twin’s cell and kick it about life and all the things we missed.  Sometimes we would take turns peeking out of the windows where the paint had peeled away trying to steal a sliver of freedom.   Like clockwork, Twin’s girlfriend came and stood outside everyday at approximately one o’clock with a sign declaring her love for him.  During that time, we allowed Twin to have the window to himself.  Our respect for her eventually led to one of the first physical conflicts I experienced.  A tall, slim, brown-skinned brother from the east side moved on the rock with us.  He appeared to be cool, so we allowed him to play cards and shoot ball with us.  Over the course of the next week, he started coming to our little counseling sessions where we talked about the things that mattered to us in life.  Most of the time, we sat in my cell or in L’s cell and kicked it, but sometimes we kicked it in Twin’s cell.  One Saturday morning, we were all sitting around in Twin’s cell smoking squares and kicking it.  Some of our court dates were getting close and we were talking about our options.  L knew more about the law than most of us because he had been in and out of prison several times.  We had all gone to the law library, but most of the books were torn up or outdated so we relied heavily on his advice and the advice from our attorneys.  After talking to us about the pros and cons of taking a plea deal, we all got ready to lock down for the afternoon count.  As we exited Twin’s cell, Twin noticed that a picture of his girl was missing.  He asked a few of us if we had seen it.  Me, Gigolo, and L told him that we hadn’t seen it and let him know that we would never take a picture of his girl.  As we were talking and helping him look for the picture, we realized that the new guy was gone.  I immediately shot out of Twin’s cell and raced down to the guy’s cell where I found his door closed and a towel hanging on the window so noone could see inside. I told him to open the door and he told me to hold on.  By this time, Twin, Gigolo and L had come down to the cell.  We demanded he open the door and he told us he was using the bathroom.  By now, the rest of the guys on the rock had come to see what all the commotion was about. I told Gigolo to grab the sheet we used to pop cell doors open so that we could get in and check the guy’s cell.  By the time we popped the door open, he was flushing the toilet.  Unfortunately for him, however, a part of the picture was still floating in the water.  I pointed to the torn picture and Twin recognized the dress that the woman was wearing, confirming that the guy had taken the picture of Twin’s girl from his cell.  Before the guy could get his explanation out, I punched him in the jaw.  He staggered against the door and tried to cover up as I delivered another punch, knocking him out of the door.  Before he could hit the ground, Gigolo and Twin started punching him in the head and face.  Then, the guy scrambled to his feet, rushed toward the door and started beating on the glass, begging a deputy to rescue him. His face was bloody and swollen and L told us to let him be until the deputies came and got him.  A deputy we called Tyson came and got him and asked him what happened.  The guy told him that we beat his ass.  We looked at each other and started laughing.  Twin explained to the deputy what really happened.  He started laughing too, and then told the guy, “I should send you back in there so they can beat your ass again.”   Tyson was one of the few deputies that understood and respected the code we lived by.  He knew we had one of the more laid back rocks and we didn’t start shit, which meant his shift went smoothly.  No one respected a thief, and what made matters worse, it turned out that the guy was being charged with rape.  The following week, things on the rock took a somber turn.  G was the first one of our circle to be found guilty on the charges he was facing.  He was convicted of posing as a police officer and robbing a couple drug dealers, who came to court and testified against G.  The night before G went for sentencing, we stayed up talking about the possibilities and what he hoped for.  He knew the charge carried a life sentence, but thought the judge would give him no more than ten years.  When he returned from sentencing and told us he had been given 85 years, we were stunned into silence.  The system had changed dramatically and we all began thinking about the time we were facing.  If they gave him 85 years for robbery, I was convinced they would give me life.   The feeling of desperation that I felt after talking to Brenda had increased tenfold.  Everyone on the rock was feeling it, and we did our best to rally around G.  Instead of being sent straight upstate, as was the custom, he stayed on the rock because he was facing another case and still had more court appearances.  During that week, they moved two more guys on the rock.  It was apparent from their interaction that they knew each other prior to moving on the rock.  From day one, they gave off a negative vibe.  Whenever they played cards, it typically led to an argument with someone on the rock.  They attempted to intimidate a few of the more laid back guys and rubbed us the wrong way.  We had seen the game before and recognized their attempts to establish their dominance.  I didn’t see them as posing a threat, so I didn’t pay them much attention.  I knew they were cowards because they were selective in who they targeted for their arguments and beefs; however, Gigolo took their behavior very personal.  He didn’t take kindly to their presence, and the tension boiled over after a few days.  We were sitting around playing cards when things escalated.  Earlier, Gigolo and one of the guys had exchanged words over Gigolo staring at him.  While they were sitting down playing cards, Gigolo tried to make light of the situation, but the guy had it in his mind to fight.  While they were talking, I noticed his partner come and stand up next to the table where we were sitting.  He told his partner to take care of his business, which told me they had planned their attack on Gigolo earlier.   The guy stood up from the table and asked Gigolo why he had been staring at him earlier.  Gigolo responded, “‘Cause you a funny-looking motherfucker.”  That was all it took to set it off.   One of the guys took a wild swing at Gigolo, who was still sitting down.  Gigolo slipped the punch, popped up on his feet and started delivering a flurry of blows to the guy before he could regain his balance.  When the guy threw the punch and missed, Gigolo took advantage of his miscalculation and started punching him in the face.  Gigolo had everything under control until the guy’s partner grabbed him from the back of the neck.  That’s when I sprung up from the table and fired on him.  I hit the guy in the eye, which caused him to release his grip on Gigolo.  My punch staggered him and I followed through with a few more punches that caused him to fall into the door.  By this time, L had rushed out of his cell and started punching the first guy who had swung on Gigolo.  Gigolo then rushed over to me and delivered some blows to the guy, who I had penned against the wall.  We continued to beat their ass until they started screaming for the deputy.  Tyson rushed around to the rock and opened the door, letting them out.  They immediately told him that we jumped them even though they had started the shit.  They started talking smack like they wanted to fight us again one-on-one, so Tyson was like, “If I open this door back up, you better go in there and fight.”  They didn’t want any more so they told him they were straight.  Tyson started laughing and talking shit about them coming on our rock starting shit.   After the two guys left, we sat around laughing and talking shit as we recounted how we had dealt with them.  At the same time, I was thinking about the guys who hadn’t come to Gigolo’s assistance.  It was proof that some of them still wanted him to get fucked up.  Later on, Gigolo came to my cell and told me he appreciated me coming to his aid.  He asked me why I had helped him and I told him I was a loyal guy. There was no way I could sit with him everyday talking about life, and then watch some guys I didn’t know beat his ass.  We laughed as we talked about all of the guys who faked like they were cool with him, but who secretly wanted to see him lose.  That incident was a reminder of some of the things we had experienced coming up in the ‘hood.  The definition of friendship was lost on a lot of guys.  Most had become cynical and distrustful of others, and some were parasitic opportunists who wouldn’t hesitate to turn their back on you when it benefitted them.  I became very careful where I placed my loyalties after that experience.  At the end of the day, I knew that I would never be able to count on anyone as much as I counted on myself.   Later that night, I was in my cell kicking it with Gigolo and L when G came to the door and told me that he needed to speak with me for a minute.  Gigolo and L got up and left the cell so that we could talk in private.  G had a serious look on his face and I could sense something was troubling him.  After he was sentenced to 85 years, we gave him space to process his emotions out of respect.  Each day, I would go down and check on him and see how he was holding up.  Some days he wanted to kick it and talk about some of the things he was feeling, and on other days, he didn’t say much but I could tell he appreciated having someone to talk to.  After L and Gigolo left, he pulled the door closed and said he had something he wanted to talk to me about.  I asked him what was on his mind and he responded by lifting up his shirt, revealing a steal pipe he had concealed in his waistband. “I know how we can get out of here,” G said as he removed the pipe from his waistband and handed it to me. I didn’t know what he had planned, but I was all ears.  As I held the heavy lead pipe in my hands, I thought about Brenda.  I thought about the look she’d have on her face when I showed up at the door of our house.  A smile crept across my face as I thought about what it would mean to be free again.  When I looked up at G, he was smiling because he knew without a doubt that I would back his play.  I pulled out a Newport and fired it up as we plotted our great return to freedom.  Chapter 5 The smell coming from my armpits reminded me of the onions that I generously garnished my Coney Island hotdog with.  Every time the wind blew, the stench from my body wafted up to my nose, causing my eyes to burn.  I looked down at the dusty red Levi’s and grungy T-shirt that I had been wearing for a few days and felt a deep sense of shame.  My hair was dirty from sleeping on the floor of Ernie’s basement and my teeth felt gritty from the plaque that had accumulated.  I hadn’t showered or brushed my teeth in days, and it was obvious. My eyes darted around as I watched a short, light-skinned woman leaving Harper Food’s Grocery Store, which sat on the corner of Harper and Newport.  Her basket was full of bags and I knew it would be my chance to get something to eat.  My stomach had passed the stage of growling and was now barking like a full-grown dog.  Up to that point, the only thing I had eaten that day was a piece of toast with a pat of butter that my friend Ernie had smuggled out to me early that morning.  Their refrigerator was basically on E so it wasn’t much he could do, so I walked a few blocks up to the grocery store to hustle up on something to eat.   I had been out in the hot sun for nearly an hour trying to hustle up on a few dollars, but no one seemed interested in allowing me to make an honest buck.  The woman coming out of the store was my last hope.  When she stepped out, I approached her swiftly while her back was turned.  Before she could protest, I retrieved two of the bags from her grocery cart. “Allow me to help with these, ma’am,” I said, mustering as much charm as I could.   She turned around, clutching her purse, and looked as though she was ready to scream.  I revealed my yellow, gap-toothed smile and proceeded to her car where I waited for her to open the trunk.  She relaxed and popped the trunk.  I took each bag from the cart and put them in her car.  When I was done, she reached into her purse and took her wallet out. “I don’t have much,” she said as she pulled two shiny quarters from her purse. I took them and stuffed them in my pocket, prepared to walk away.  I guess she could sense my disappointment because she called me back.   “Here, take this and get you something to eat,” she said as she handed me a food stamp that was worth a dollar.  I took it with a smile and rushed inside the grocery store.  I grabbed a grape Faygo soda, a bag of Better Made Hot Chips, and a pack of cookies.  When I came out of the store, I looked around, then darted into the alley behind the grocery store.  I kneeled down on the side of the dumpster and ripped the bag of chips open.  I stuffed them in my mouth greedily before sucking down the sweet, purple soda.  The stench of rotted food coming from the dumpster wasn’t enough to spoil my appetite, nor were the maggots that were feasting on a pool of reddish liquid next to me.  I was so hungry that it felt like my stomach was about to start eating my spine if I didn’t get the food down fast enough.  Once my stomach started filling up, I stood up and exited the alley.  I knew Ernie would enjoy some of the cookies and the rest of the chips I had in the bag, but I wanted to make sure I was good before sharing my rations.  I started walking down Newport toward Wade.  The Fila’s I had on were on their last leg and I had to walk with my toe curled in order to avoid it dragging on the ground through the hole in the bottom of my shoes.  As I walked past each street, nearing my own, my palms started sweating.  It had been nearly two weeks since I left home and the last thing I wanted was for my mother to see me in my current condition.  I didn’t want to hear her saying “I told you so.”  So far, she had proven to be right when it came to being out on my own.  I hadn’t thought my exit strategy through, and by the time I realized it was extremely hard for a child to make it in an adult world, it was too late.  My pride and stubbornness wouldn’t allow me to go back nor did I have a desire to return to a place where I felt unwanted.  It was still early and there weren’t many people out on my block.  I breathed a sigh of relief when I reached Camden and didn’t see anyone I knew.  I looked down toward my mother’s house and saw her Monte Carlo sitting in the driveway.  A twinge of sadness shot through my body as I thought about how life used to be.  I stuffed it back down where I concealed the rest of the emotions that made me feel vulnerable and kept walking until I reached Wade, which was the next street.  Before I made it to the corner, I could see everyone was out at Kurt’s house, which was the corner house next door to Ernie’s.  I groaned inside when I noticed a few of the older guys from my neighborhood hanging out on the porch.  They were laughing and joking around with each other when I approached.  It was a ‘hood custom for us to crack jokes on each other and nothing was off limits.  The more uncomfortable the person who was the butt of the joke, the more the crowd laughed.  Looking down at my attire, I knew I was walking into the line of fire when I approached.  For the last week or so, I had been on the receiving end of jokes about my clothes and hygiene, but the most painful jokes came at the end of the day when some of the older guys cracked jokes about me not having anywhere to go.  I felt like a bum.  There was nothing like being homeless.  I tried to laugh along with them like their words didn’t faze me, but underneath, my feelings were being torn to shreds.  There were even moments when I was so angry that I wanted to fight, which made everyone laugh even harder because I wasn’t big enough to beat any of them.  Before I made it up to the porch, I could hear them snickering.  When I saw that Ernie wasn’t outside, I went next door and they immediately started cracking on my shoes and dirty pants.  I held back the tears that were beginning to fight their way to the surface.  In that moment, I wanted to cut through the alley and go home.  I didn’t know how much more I could take being the neighborhood joke.  Moments later, Ernie came to the door and let me in.  I handed him the rest of the chips and cookies and went straight down into the basement where I listened to a mixed tape that Ernie was playing on his boombox.  A few minutes later, another one of my friends named Tommie Seymour came over.  We talked about what we would get into for the day before we went back outside.  Tommie and Ernie were the only ones that seemed to understand what I was going through at home, and they did what they could to help me out.  When we stepped outside, most of the guys next door were gone so we went and sat on Kurt’s porch.  We were sitting there talking when we heard the sound of deep bass coming from down the block.  We all looked around, waiting to see who would come driving by with their sounds thumping.  It was the newest phenomenon erupting in ‘hoods all across the city.   Our neighborhood was home to some of the most notorious drug gangs from the crack era.  From the Best Friends and the Chambers Brothers to White Boy Rick, who grew up around the corner from us, our streets were flooded with neighborhood superstars.  The sounds blaring from their fancy rides drew the envy and attention of all the younger guys and girls in the ‘hood, including ours.  Whenever one of them would zip past in their Jeep Wrangler or Jeep Cherokee with the music thundering out of the back, we would stand around talking to each other about our dream rides.  For the first time in our young lives, we were witnessing guys our age living the American Dream, and we all wanted a share.   Moments after we heard the sound of the music, a small, white Dodge Omni stopped at the corner.  The music was pumping loudly from a house speaker situated in the back hatch.  “That’s Miko,” Tommie said as he got off of the porch to greet the tall, light-skinned, muscular man.  We watched from the porch as they talked for a few minutes, then Tommie came back up and told us what they had talked about.  He said Miko was looking for someone to “roll” for him, which was the name we used for selling drugs.  He said Miko was paying up to $350.00 a week plus ten dollars a day food fare for anyone willing to sit in one of his drug spots.  The catch was, whoever decided to do it had to be willing to sit in the spot 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  I didn’t care.  All I could think about was having somewhere to lay my head and a way to feed and clothe myself.  I didn’t give any thought to the potential danger that was ahead of me, including getting robbed, killed or jailed.  Ernie didn’t want to do it and Tommie said he couldn’t.  They both turned to me and told me that rolling for Miko would be a way for me to get off of the streets.  I had already given consideration to what they said before they said it, and without further discussion, told Tommie that I would do it.  He walked back down to the car and told Miko that I was down to roll.   Miko called me over and asked me my name.  I told him that my name was Pumpkin, which was the nickname that my aunt had given me.  It was also Tommie’s nickname and one of the things that cemented our bond.  We both knew how hard we had to fight so that others wouldn’t think we were soft because of our unflattering nicknames.   “You got to come up with another name, lil’ homie,” said Miko as he took in my disheveled appearance. “What’s your real name?” he asked.  “James,” I responded as I thought about a new nickname. “You should call yourself Jay,” he replied.  “Yeah, that sound slick,” I said as I thought about my new nickname.  Miko talked to Tommie for a few minutes before he got back in the car.  He told me to hop in the passenger seat, then we sped off down the street to the sounds of Cybotron beating from the speakers.  It was the perfect soundtrack for our neighborhood.  The fast-paced techno-house music coincided with the rhythm of our young lives.  “You had something to eat yet?” Miko asked.  “Some chips and cookies,” I replied as I thought about the last time I had a full meal.  “I’mma shoot up to Burger King before we go over to the spot.” “Alright,” I responded as I watched the houses and cars zip by. We pulled up to the Burger King on Gratiot, which was a stone’s throw from the Ninth Precinct of the Detroit Police Department.  Miko turned down the music as we pulled into the parking lot.  When we got out of the car, I felt a nervous energy course through my body at the site of a police car, which was pulling out of the lot.  In that moment, I didn’t know how much time I would be faced with if I were caught selling drugs, nor did I think about the fact that I could get killed or charged with any number of crimes that were associated with selling drugs.  All I knew was that I would be able to house and clothe myself.  This ignorance was something that the older guys preyed on.  We headed over to a street named Flanders where the spot was located.  We pulled in front of a dilapidated two-family flat that looked like it would fall over if the wind blew too hard.  The house sat in the middle of the block between two other houses that looked like they had seen better days.  When we got out of the car, I noticed a silhouette in the doorway.  The porch steps creaked as we ascended them.  I carefully stepped over a gap where a step used to be before I reached the top of the splintered porch.  “Hey, Miko,” a dark-skinned, slender woman said as she opened the door for us to come inside. “What’s up, Dee,” Miko responded as we stepped into the dark living room. “Who is lil’ man?” she asked as she gave me the once over.  “This my little brother, Jay,” he said, introducing me. “He gonna be holding down the spot over here,” he continued as he retrieved a plastic bag from his underwear and walked toward the dining room.  “Where that mirror at?” he asked as he stepped over to the table.  “I got it,” Dee said as she went into the other room. “These are nickels and go for five dollars a piece.  It’s a hundred rocks in this bag,” he explained, holding it up so I could see.  “Alright,” I said, nodding my head.  “How much does that come up to?” he asked. “Five hundred dollars,” I said calmly.  “Okay, lil’ nigga. I see you can count.  All the sacks I give you will be the same, but it’s up to you to count them.  That way, you’ll know I ain’t cheating you,” he said as he gave me a valuable rule of the game.  In the world of criminality, no one is to be trusted.  It is a predatory and parasitic world, and nearly everyone is out to get over in some way, even on those they employ.  This was American greed at its finest.  Dee returned with a mirror.  Miko poured the contents of the bag onto the mirror and then counted the rocks out into piles of twenty.  I watched his every move and did the math in my head.  I was amazed that that small bag held what was a small fortune in my mind. “When you sell the first two rocks, keep that for your food and cigarettes or whatever you want for the day.  When you get down to the last 20 rocks, call me so that I can bring you some more, alright?” “Yeah,” I responded as I took the bag.  “Keep the sack in your drawers and don’t let anyone else hold the sack.  When someone comes through, Dee will let you know if they are straight.  Don’t show them shit until they show you the money.  Once you have your money, give them a rock.  Don’t sit there and haggle with them over the size of the rock.  This ain’t the store, and the customers aren’t always right.  But at the same time, treat them the way you want to be treated,” he explained, schooling me to the game.  “I got you,” I responded as the excitement of selling drugs began taking over.  “Let me show you where the heat at, in case somebody get out of line,” he said to me as he led me into the back room where he pulled a sawed-off shotgun from beneath a soiled mattress.  I had never held a shotgun before and I was intimidated by the menacing look of it.  It looked like it would knock me to the ground if I pulled the trigger, but I took it and held it like I knew what I was doing when he gave it to me.   “That button right there is the safety.  If a nigga get out of line, take the safety off, point it at him and shoot.  Trust me, this will tear they motherfucking head off,” Miko said as he explained the workings of the gun to me.   I didn’t know how to respond because I hadn’t thought about shooting anyone.  I had no idea that crack could turn people into stone-cold killers.  I had seen people smoking weed and drinking, but the most that ever happened was a fight.   “I’m going to pick up your partner named Tee.  He good people and will have your back, but this is your spot,” Miko said.  “So run it the way you want it ran,” he continued, turning the spot on Flanders over to me.  Ten minutes after Miko left, the first customer came to the door.  Dee answered it and told me what he wanted.  I came to the door and retrieved his money through the Armor Guard we had on the door for protection.  I took the crumpled twenty-dollar bill and gave him four rocks.  He looked them over and smiled before leaving the porch.  When he left, I took the twenty-dollar bill out of my pocket and looked at it for a minute.  It was my first official sale, and in that moment, things became very real for me.  I was officially a drug dealer.  Within a few hours, customers started flowing through the spot like water.  My pockets were quickly filling up with five-dollar bills until I had a fat knot bulging from my pants pocket.  The first week shot by and I was excited when Miko came through to pay me.  He deducted about 75 dollars for rocks, which I had spent during the week on clothes that the customers came through trying to sell.  He told me to take the rest off of the first sales that I made for the day.  When I was finished, he told me to call him and he would take me out to Eastland Mall to shop.  All I could think about was what I would buy.  At the time, Fila was the hottest shit out and Guess jeans and overalls were the clothing apparel of choice.   When we hit Eastland, I couldn’t wait to go to Foot Locker and cop a crispy pair of Fila’s.  I felt cocky as I pulled my knot of money out of my pocket and paid for my shoes.  It was the first time I had been able to go into a store and get exactly what I wanted without having to worry about how much it cost.  We continued shopping and Miko bought me a few other items to go with my gear.  He was embracing me like a little brother and told me he always wanted me to be fresh. Things were cool for the first few weeks.  I stayed fresh with the latest gear and kept a knot of money in my pocket, but it wasn’t long before things started going crazy.  The sacks started coming up short and I thought Dee was stealing from me.  I couldn’t figure out how she was doing it because I kept the sack in my underwear, and if I didn’t have it, Tee kept it with him.  Whenever we both had to leave, we hid everything in the vacant flat upstairs.  It wasn’t until a month or so later that I found out Tee was stealing the rocks and putting them in his joints.  I had no idea that he was smoking fifty-ones, which was the name we had given crack-laced joints.  In addition to Tee stealing, the Chambers Brothers had a spot a couple of houses down.  The guy they had running the spot was crazy and strung out on fifty-ones.  He foamed at the mouth and would run up and down the street with no shirt on ranting and raving.  He was unpredictable and would sometimes jump on the customers.  About every other week, the police had to chase him on top of the roof of the house that they were selling out of.  He would eventually tire and come down and the police would take him in on a misdemeanor charge.  The one thing I liked was when he came down to our spot and bought up nearly the whole sack.  Our rocks were bigger than theirs, so he would buy ours and chip them down.  He would smoke what he wanted and still make the money he owed the Chambers Brothers.  Whenever he came through, I made sure to let him see the sawed-off shotgun.  Despite how crazy he acted, he turned out to be my best customer.  If it weren’t for him, things would have been a bit slow.  Within a few weeks, I was into the full swing of hustling.  The money came quick and I found ways to spend it quicker.  The more I made, the more I spent.  I didn’t realize it then, but I was overcompensating for the things I felt were missing in my life – love and acceptance.  As good as the money was on Flanders, at the end of each night I felt empty and lonely.  Tee was a few years older, so there wasn’t much we had in common besides making fast money.  I couldn’t relate to Dee or her husband because they were high all of the time.  One of the things I respected about them, however, was that they never smoked crack in front of me.  I could tell when they were high because they acted jittery and paranoid, but I never saw them use.  It wasn’t until a few weeks later that I would learn the inner workings of the drug trade and the power of drug addiction.  One day, a customer named John came through to buy some rocks.  He was what we called a “runner.”  He would make crackhouse runs for a small gathering of smokers who hung out at his house.  He would get all of their money and find the best spot to cop at.  In the process, he got the extra rocks from whatever deal he could negotiate, plus they would share their rocks with him.  He was a frequent customer and usually bought two or three hundred dollars worth of rocks at a time.  This time, after buying one hundred and fifty dollars worth of rocks, he asked if we would be interested in rolling out of his house.  He told me he had a spot on Wilshire that he was interested in opening.  I told him that I would run it by Miko and we could come through and check it out.  I called Miko and told him that I had a prospective spot to set up shop.  He told me he would come by and pick me up so that we could check it out.  When he arrived, he told me that he was proud of me for thinking about expanding the business, and if things went right, he would take care of me.  That got me excited and I thought about what it would feel like to make more money.  We hopped in the car and drove back down toward our part of the neighborhood.   John lived three houses off of the corner of Wilshire and Chalmers.  On the corner of the block was a grocery store, and two blocks over was a Seven Eleven.  The street was lined with well-kept brick colonials and Tudors, and John lived in a big, pretty brick house that was a stark contrast to the house on Flanders.  Miko asked me if I was sure I had the right house and I showed him the address that John had written down.   John opened the door and let us inside.  He told us the story of how he lost his job, wife and kids as a result of smoking.  Allowing us to sell out of his house would allow him to keep his home and support his habit.  It was in this spot that I learned everything I needed to know about being in the streets.  I learned how the human psyche responded to addiction and desperation; how money and power breeds arrogance and leads to some of the most sadistic behavior imaginable. When we stepped inside of John’s house, we were surprised to find that it still had the appearance of a home instead of a crackhouse.  There were relics of his former life as a middle class family man.  Framed pictures of his wife and children were hung on a wall in the dining room.  The living room was well furnished with a floor model television and sectional couch.  It felt like the woman of the house would descend from the stairs and ask if we wanted refreshments, but that never happened.  Instead, we got down to business. Before long, the house on Wilshire began to reflect a sinister energy that seemed to haunt our neighborhood.  This was the ‘hood I grew up in, but little did I know, I was contributing to the death and devastation that led to its ultimate demise.   During the embryonic stages of the crack epidemic, my old neighborhood was still considered one of the better neighborhoods on the east side of Detroit.  Most of the houses maintained pristine exteriors, but on the interior, the families were beingly slowly consumed by the madness of addiction.  The promise of the Black middle class was slowly eroding as crack entrenched itself deep into the heart of the ‘hood.  This was a recurring cycle that manifested in our community.  In the sixties and seventies, it was heroin that wreaked havoc, and in the eighties, we were faced with the greatest evil of our generation – crack cocaine.  We set up shop on Wilshire quickly and developed what would become the urban version of a traditional business model.  We installed Armor Guard in the doorway between the kitchen and the stairway leading to the basement.  We did this so that our customers could walk right in instead of being clustered outside around the door waiting to be served.  For customers who wanted to stay and smoke, John charged them a couple of dollars or a piece of their rock.  It worked to our benefit because some of the customers would end up spending their whole day and their entire paycheck down in the basement.  It also cut down on the excessive traffic, which was a nuisance to our neighbors.  Within three days, things began picking up and I got a firsthand education in street life.  John had numerous friends who smoked and most of them worked at one of the factories in the area so their money was always good and consistent.  Our spot was one of the first in that part of the neighborhood, which was convenient for our upscale clients.  The only competition we had came from some guys who had a spot a couple of blocks over.  Their rocks were small by comparison, so they didn’t pose any threat to us.  After a few days, I grew bored sitting upstairs all by myself so I ventured down into the basement.  That was my first time seeing anyone smoke crack.  I sat behind the bar with the shotgun and took in the scene, which reminded me of a scene from a movie.  There were mirrors, razor blades, and pipes spread across the bar alongside a bottle of 150 Proof Old Florida Rum, which was used to make torches.  I watched men and women smoke their pipes with such intimacy that it looked like they were making love.  The look of ecstasy that came over them when they inhaled the thick, white smoke into their lungs was mesmerizing.  I had never witnessed anything transform a person so quickly or dramatically as a hit from a crack pipe.   I had seen people smoke weed and drink, but all that did was mellow them out or give them the munchies.  I had seen a few people get really drunk and act a fool, but that was a rare experience for me at the time.  Watching crack addicts get high literally blew my young mind.  What was interesting is that the drug impacted them all differently.  There were some who got so paranoid that they hid in the closet beneath the stairs or jumped behind the bar and sat curled up in a ball on the floor.   A week after I ventured down into the basement, a lady who lived around the corner stripped all of her clothes off and ran out of the house naked.  She said that someone was chasing her.  John gave chase and eventually brought her back into the house where she sat naked at the bar smoking.  I tried not to stare at her breasts or the triangle of hair between her legs, but I couldn’t help myself.  I was intrigued by the female anatomy and my fascination with women was just beginning.  One particular episode had me on the floor laughing.  One day when I was down in the basement serving a customer, I noticed another customer crawling on the floor picking up every white speck that he came across.  I asked what was going on and another customer told me that he was ‘ghosting.’  I asked him what that meant, and he told me that the other smoker had smoked all of his crack and was having illusions that the floor was covered with rocks.  This became a common occurrence.  It was crazy watching grown men and women on their knees searching the basement floor, hoping they would find a crumb of crack.  I was so insensitive to their plight and ignorant to the seriousness of addiction that I would laugh at them until my stomach felt like it was going to burst.  I didn’t realize it then, but I was growing desensitized to the suffering of others.  I had begun developing a warped view of adults and the respect I once held was slowly diminishing. The money on Wilshire began flowing in a steady stream and I met a wide range of people in the first month or so of business.  Every personality type imaginable came through the door.  Our clientele consisted of White people, Black people, men, women, and upper-middle class on down to ghetto.  We also had some of the best boosters come through.  For just a few rocks, I bought leather coats and silk shirts that were worth hundreds of dollars.  They sold me televisions, VCRs, and handguns for little or nothing.  Even though I wasn’t old enough to drive, I also rented Cadillac’s, Monte Carlo’s, and Regal’s for a couple of hours in exchange for a few rocks.  They ran errands for me, lied for me, and would have killed for me or killed me, all for the love of crack.  Women would come over to clean up the house and wash our clothes for a rock.  Things always started off innocent, but it wasn‘t long before they were cleaning up naked.  This was during the early days of crack when it was still considered a glamorous drug, so the women coming through were still attractive and still dressed with pride and dignity.  Within a few months, these same women wore the visible signs of addiction – dirty clothes and muddled hair.  Sex was also there for the taking.  Women who were married with children older than me exchanged sex for rocks.  They would offer to give blowjobs or fuck the entire crew.  The first time I saw what crack did to women came about two weeks after I started working on Wilshire. John had a woman come through who worked at one of the local strip clubs.  He told us that she would perform for us if we gave her a rock.  There were a couple of the guys from the ‘hood hanging out with us and they wanted to see what she was about.  None of us had any real experience with grown women and we were excited to see what she had to offer that our teenage girlfriends didn’t.  After taking a couple hits off of her pipe, she took all of her clothes off and began dancing sensuously.  She rubbed and caressed her body before lying on the floor and spreading her legs.  She masturbated in front of us, and then asked for a lit cigarette.  We all stood around speechless as we watched her slide the cigarette into her pussy. Using her stomach muscles, she sucked the smoke into her vagina, then removed the cigarette and allowed the smoke to waft back out.  That was the first time I had seen a woman’s pussy spread all the way open.  She had clearly raised the bar and every woman that came through after that competed to top her feats.  I took my cues from the older hustlers I was around, and it wasn’t long before I began to objectify women.   A month or so later while working another spot on Bewick between Warren and Shoemaker, a customer, who everyone called the head doctor, came through.  She was so proficient with her oral skills that she offered me a money back guarantee.  She told me if she couldn’t make me cum in a matter of minutes, the blowjob was on her.  I was thirteen years old standing on the side of a crackhouse getting a blowjob, experiencing something that grown men experienced.  I was being sucked – figuratively and literally – into a world unfit for a child.  Her head game was official and I gave her a rock for her services.   Like many women who came through the spot, she said all the right things, making me feel and think that it was okay to be having sex with a grown woman.  I didn’t realize that she was a pedophile who preyed on the raging hormones of young dealers.  Nevertheless, at the age of thirteen, I had sexual command over grown women who were willing to do anything for a quick high.  They made me feel like my pleasure was the only thing that mattered.  Before long, I began developing a distorted view of women and girls.  I couldn’t relate to girls my age anymore because they weren’t ready to do the things I was accustomed to doing.  In fact, I grew very impatient with girls my age, and if they wouldn’t have sex with me, I would dismiss them and let them know that I could get pussy and head whenever I wanted to.   I had been raised to respect and honor women; however, in the world that I was living in, those rules no longer applied.  It was hard to respect people who didn’t respect themselves.  Looking back, I believe the crack epidemic led to the misogyny that exists within our community and in hip hop culture specifically.  Growing up, it was nearly unheard of for men to refer to women as hoes and bitches; however, in the streets, these terms became the norm.   Day by day, we were all being stripped of our morals. In fact, it seemed that the level of disrespect grew in proportion to the deceit and manipulation that we experienced dealing with our customers.  Some women were notorious for stealing sacks and pockets full of money while they performed fellatio.  We learned through trial and error that no one was to be trusted, yet we didn’t always go by what we knew.  My lessons continued with each day in the basement.  The smokers would get into squabbles over things that would seem crazy to the casual observer, but I quickly learned that this subculture had its own rules.  One of the biggest causes of conflict was when one smoker cleaned another smoker’s pipe.  They used alcohol to extract the oil residue left behind after they smoked the rock.  They would pour the contents of the pipe on a mirror and set it on fire, leaving behind a powdery residue.  They would then scrape this residue off of the mirror, reinsert it into the pipe and smoke it.  Between this and the fights over someone smoking more than their fair share of the rock, there was always drama; they were always trying to get over on each other or steal from each other.  I learned a lot from watching their antics, including how to cook up my own batches of crack.  I would gather all of the crumbs that shook loose inside the bags of rocks I had.  I would place them in a glass vial, add baking soda, and then heat it up with a torch.  I would cook it until it congealed into an oily mass.  I would then dip the vial in ice water and watch as the cocaine hardened into rock form.  It was a valuable lesson that I would later use when I ventured out on my own as a dealer.   The most important lesson I learned was that crack was nothing to be played with; it wreaked havoc in people’s lives and destroyed families.  There were people I grew up respecting and admiring who I now looked upon with shame and disgust.  I witnessed some of the big homies fall prey to the pipe; guys I once looked up to were now groveling at my feet, begging for rocks on credit.   I saw women who were at one time beautiful teachers, homemakers, students and store clerks reduced to unkempt crack whores.   My early experiences in the streets caused me to lose my focus, my respect for the community, and ultimately, my own identity.  I was raised to be respectful of adults and caring toward people, but in the streets those were signs of weakness.  I quickly learned that the streets were unforgiving and would rape you of everything if you were too compassionate or caring.  However, after weeks of watching the guys I sold crack with, I soon became a callous, apathetic, cold-hearted predator on our community just like them.  I wasn’t as quick to anger or resort to violence as some of the guys I ran with, but it wouldn’t be long before I recognized that anger and violence were a necessary part of the dope game and I would have to employ them if I wanted to survive.   Over the summer, Miko opened up a few more spots throughout our neighborhood.  We operated like another corporate structure.  We were all about expanding into other areas and taking advantage of new clientele.  Miko was making a lot of money off of my hustling ability and dedication, sitting in spots twenty-four hours a day.  Like many CEO’s, he made all of the money while I did the bulk of the work.  At the time, I didn’t understand how much I was being exploited.  All I knew was that I stayed fresh and my pockets were fat.  I didn’t have any long-term plans or an exit strategy.  I allowed my self-worth to be defined by what kind of shoes and clothes I wore and what others thought about me.  It was the nature of the game. As cool as Miko appeared, he was really out for himself and I was just a means to an end.  When we started out, Miko was driving a Dodge Omni, which only cost him a few hundred dollars.  By the end of the summer, he had purchased a new Jeep Wrangler and Pontiac Grand AM outfitted with a top flight Kenwood sound system.  Although modest by today’s standards, these cars were two of the most popular modes of transportation at the time.  In contrast, all I had to show for my hard work was a bunch of clothes and shoes.  But I was young and didn’t care; I thought that was how the game went.   As time went on, I started seeing things a little differently; I realized that I was being used and Miko didn’t really give a fuck about me or my life.  Once I discovered this, I started doing things my way.  I told Miko that I wanted to make more money and be paid by the sack.  I was surprised when he agreed to my terms.  In exchange, I started recruiting more guys to roll for him.  Outside of Tee, our whole crew consisted of guys that I had recruited to come and roll for Miko.  These were guys I hung out with on a regular basis but now I was in a position of power. When I first ran away, a lot of the guys that I grew up with ridiculed and shunned me like I had the plague.  I wore borrowed clothes for days at a time and was often hungry and dirty.  As soon as I started getting a little money, however, the same people who cracked jokes on me started showing love.  Looking back, I know it’s the love and acceptance that a guy gets once he starts making money that keeps so many of us chasing the street dream and grand illusions of financial success.   Like most teenagers, I wanted to be accepted and exalted by my peers, and when I came through the ‘hood with the fresh Fila’s, Bally’s and Jordan’s, I felt like a superstar.  The girls talked about how good I looked in my Guess jeans and Calvin Klein outfit.  The attention and illusion of respect that I got was just as addictive as the drugs that I sold.  It was this allure that many were willing to die or kill for, including me.  Back then, when I came through the ‘hood with a four hundred dollar Fila jogging suit, word spread through the ‘hood like wildfire.  Today, it’s a little different.  Instead of jogging suits, it’s Cartier glasses and Rolex watches, but the experience is the same.  During that era, not everyone could afford the things I was buying or wearing, and at the ages of 13 and 14, my wardrobe cost more than the adults’ in my ‘hood.   When I pulled up in front of Kurt’s house on an Elite 150 Deluxe moped with my pockets bulging, people broke their necks trying to find out who I was down with.  The same guys that said I was stupid for selling dope were now trying to get down with us.  Instead of treating them badly because they had played me, I told them I would put them on.   At the time, I was making ten dollars off of every hundred dollars worth of rocks that I sold, plus an extra two dollars in tops.  Instead of selling five-dollar rocks, we were now selling bigger rocks for twelve dollars.  I kept the extra two in addition to the ten that I made off of every hundred.  I went from making $350.00 a week to making $300.00 off of every thousand-dollar sack that I sold.   The spot on Wilshire proved to be very lucrative in this regard.  On a good day, three to four thousand dollars worth of rocks could be sold.  Sometimes it took a few days to get off one sack, but for the most part Wilshire did very well.  I would let some of the homies work a sack and make most of the money.  I might tell them to kick me down $50 and keep the $250 for themselves because they were the ones responsible for the sack.  No matter what I did that day, they had to stay behind and roll, but they got first shot at whatever the boosters brought through.  They also bought the beer, food and weed for the day.  Over time, we ended up with a nine-member crew and all but two of them were homeboys that I had brought on board.  Everybody had spots of their own to work and we typically worked in groups of two.  Wilshire was mine, but since Miko trusted me the most out of our crew, I often spent time riding around with him looking for new areas to open spots.  Some days I would work other spots and let some of the other homies work Wilshire since it was doing the best.  At the end of the day, I wanted everyone in the crew to shine.  I was loyal to a fault and wanted more for my homies than they wanted for me.  I saw what we were doing as a means to take care of ourselves.  I didn’t take into consideration that we were essentially killing our childhood and destroying our community by selling the poisonous rocks.  After a while, Miko started recruiting some of his guys to sell for him.  This decision created a lot of animosity amongst the crew.  Miko felt like we were spoiled compared to guys who were rolling for other drug crews and he was trying to replace my guys with his own.  We knew some of the guys he brought in, but we weren’t cool with them, which added to the tension.  A few months later, the spot on Flanders got raided and it revealed a lot to us.  Ernie was rolling the spot by himself when the police kicked in the door.  They didn’t find any dope, but they found a pistol and charged Ernie with carrying a concealed weapon.  Miko didn’t post his bail because he said Ernie had just started working for him.  His failure to bond one of our homies didn’t sit right with us.  Ernie was risking his life and freedom and we felt the least he could do was bond him out.  Adding insult to injury, Miko started telling guys that they could roll out of Wilshire.  I felt disrespected because he was cutting my guys out of the picture.  In turn, some of my guys started running off with his dope, and things quickly went down hill from there.  One day, I came to check on Wilshire because one of my guys was supposed to be rolling there that day.  When I got there, a guy named Henry was sitting in the spot rolling.  I was pissed and told him to give me the sack he had.  He refused and I punched him in the face.  One of my guys then punched him a few times and he took off running out of the house.  Henry called Miko and told him that we had jumped on him.  Miko came over and asked me what was up.  I told him that I didn’t want Henry rolling on Wilshire.  He sided with my decision because he had just really met Henry, but the cleft between us was widening.  Some of the crew had started smoking laced joints and fucking up the sacks.  One day, Miko knocked one of my homie’s teeth out because he had smoked up most of the sack.  It was fucked up because we had all grown up in the same ‘hood; however, the evil roots of crack were embedding themselves deeper and deeper into our neighborhood, leaving no home, no family and no friendship untouched.  As the summer heated up, the madness intensified and I found myself in over my head.  I was no longer just addicted to the fast money, I was now addicted to the violence of the lifestyle, and it was only a matter of time before I found myself addicted to crack itself.  Yep, I violated the sacred code, “Don’t get high off your own supply.”  At 14, I became a victim of the devil’s smoke.  Chapter 6 The butterflies in my stomach stirred as I stood at the front door of our small ranch home on Blackstone.  The familiar feeling of running the block in Brightmoor warmed my body as I waited for Brenda to answer the door.  My palms were sweating and my heart raced as I waited for her to open the door.  My hand was heavy as I reached up to bang on the door.  When Brenda opened the door, she had an angelic smile on her face.  She rushed out of the door and into my arms.  “I miss you so much,” she said as she leapt into my arms and smothered my face with feather soft kisses.  “I told you I was coming home one way or another,” I said as I embraced her tightly. Before I was able to step inside the house, I was awakened from my dream by the sound of someone tapping on my cell door.  A smile creased my face as I stirred from my sleep.  Normally I would be pissed if someone woke me from my dreams, but this time it was different.  I knew we were about to turn this dream into reality and it would only be a matter of time before I was back on the block.  I hopped off of the bunk and looked out of the window to see who was at the door.  It took my eyes a minute to adjust to the darkness, but I could see a shadowy figure standing at my cell door.  It was after two o’clock in the morning and I knew that the only person likely to be out at that time was Gigolo.  We had developed a method for getting out of our cells whenever we felt like it.  We would take a sheet and tie a knot to it, then slide the knot beneath the door, pull the sheet up between the door jam and shake it until it popped open.  We would come out at night to sneak and use the phones or light up our cigarettes on the wall lighter.   “Wassup?” I whispered through the crack.  “I need to holla at you for a minute,” G said as he slid the knotted sheet beneath my door.   I hooked it onto the door and we shook the door until it popped open.  I grabbed a couple of squares and slid out of my cell headed for the dayroom.  “Wassup?” I asked as I fired up the square. “I think Gigolo and Jabo want to roll with us,” he revealed as we sat on the floor beneath the officer’s booth. “You talked to them?” I asked. “Yeah, but I didn’t go into any detail about what we were going to do,” he said, assuring me that he hadn’t divulged our sophisticated plan.  I was relieved that he hadn’t said anything because I wanted to be present at all discussions regarding the escape.  Even though G had sparked the idea, I was responsible for the planning and orchestration of the plan.  He recognized that his initial plan to bludgeon the officer and take his uniform would have never worked.  We may have made it to the elevator on the sixth floor, but there was no way we would have made it out of the building with one uniform at three o’clock in the morning.  Instead, I devised what I felt was a fail-proof plan. “Let’s see if they’re woke,” I suggested as I stubbed out my cigarette. “Alright,” G responded as we crept over to Gigolo’s cell.  When I peeked into the cell, I could see Gigolo sitting at the desk talking to his bunky.  I tapped the window and he came to the door.  “Let me holla at you for a minute,” I said.  We popped the door, then went and got Jabo.  I asked them what they thought about escaping from the county jail.  Jabo hadn’t been to court yet, but knew he was facing a lot of time, and Gigolo was still waiting to go to trial.  My sentencing date was only weeks away and I felt like I had nothing to lose; however, their situation was different and I wanted to be sure that they would be down to rock with us before I told them what was up.  Both of them said that they were down to bust out as soon as we put the plan in motion.  I told them we would leave on the Sunday coming up, which meant we had five days to finalize everything.   I wanted to tell L what was up, but I knew he would try to talk me out of it.  L was a real religious brother and often quoted from the Bible.  We respected his wisdom, but at the time, I wasn’t willing to trust my freedom with a God I couldn’t see.  For the four years I was on the streets, the only thing I believed in was the power of money and guns, so I wasn’t about to allow him to talk me out of it, nor did I want to hear a sermon about trusting the Lord.  I wanted to be free so that I could be with Brenda and our unborn child.  I had missed out on the birth of my daughter, but I would be damned if I missed the birth of my next child.  Gigolo suggested we get as many sheets as we could from the guys on the rock and the deputy when she passed them out.  I hid the pipe in my mattress and we waited patiently for Sunday night to roll around.  We did our best to conceal our excitement from the rest of the guys on the rock, but when we were alone in one of the cells kicking it, we couldn’t stop talking about what we were going to do when we got out.  We talked about the sex we would have, the alcohol we would consume, the money we would make, and the food we would eat.  We didn’t give any real consideration to what it would be like living on the run for the rest of our lives.  All we were focused on was the power of the moment.  During that week, I talked to Brenda nearly every day.  She gave me updates on the growth of the baby in her womb, and we talked about the things we missed about being with each other.  We continued to plan a life together despite the fact that I was waiting to be sentenced.  I kept telling her that I would be home soon, but I never alluded to the fact that I was about to commit an act of desperation in my efforts to get there. When Sunday rolled around, we spent the day making the final preparations.  We gathered the food we had collected from the commissary and made sure everyone had the extra socks and T-shirts that they needed to wear when we made it down to the streets.  In the county, we weren’t allowed to have gym shoes, so we decided the best thing to do was pull a few pair of socks over our shower shoes to absorb the blow when we hit the ground.   All day it felt like time was moving in slow motion.  I thought the night would never arrive, but finally it did.  After the deputy completed his 2a.m. count rounds, Gigolo popped his cell door and came down to my cell.  He had his county shirt tied around his face like a ninja.  I wrapped my face the same way and helped him pop my cell door.  My bunky asked what was up and I told him to go back to sleep and mind his business.  He was a metro-sexual, feminine-acting cat and we never really spoke so he went with the program.  I had slid the pipe out of my mattress when we first locked down for the night and grabbed it as I prepared to exit the cell.  It was the first time Gigolo had a chance to hold it and feel the weight of it.  “Damn homie, this a bad motherfucker,” he said, feeling the weight of the pipe as I helped G pop his cell door.  Finally, we went to get Jabo out of his cell.  We sat around for a minute smoking what we thought would be our last square on lockdown.  When the final Newport was put out, it was showtime.  Since G was the biggest and strongest among the four of us, he was the first one to take a turn at breaking the thick, plyglass window.  The first hit to the window sounded like a gun blast.  My heart pounded in rhythm with his hits on the window, one ferocious blast after another.  My body was on fire with adrenaline and excitement and I couldn’t wait for my turn on the window.  The noise from G hitting the window was so loud that we couldn’t hear the guys on the rock screaming for us to stop.  Finally, after he was near exhaustion, G stopped and handed me the pipe, which was warm to the touch. When I approached the window, I heard someone screaming from one of the cells for us to stop before we got everyone in trouble.  Gigolo went to their window and told them to shut the fuck up and get back in the bed.  I laughed a little before I went to work beating on the window, increasing the damage that G had started. Finally, the edge of the window gave way and we were able to push the rest of the window open.  I tried to squeeze between the two beams that were inside the frame and realized that I could only get part of my shoulder through it, so we went to work bending the beam with the pipe.  We wedged the pipe between the wall and the beam and rocked it back and forth, bending the beam a little bit at a time.  After a few minutes, I tried to slide my upper torso through the window, but still couldn’t fit all the way through.   We had made enough progress to know that we were only minutes away from being able to climb down the sheets we had tied together toward freedom.  We went back to bending the beam as the guys on the rock hollered at us to go back to our cells.  We didn’t give a damn about them being afraid.  The only thing that mattered to us was our freedom.   We continued to bend the beam for about ten minutes before we stopped.  G tried to squeeze through the window and we got excited when we saw how much progress we had made.  We each took a turn seeing if we could fit through the window.  When we got around to me, I tried to fit my head out, and just as I was working my way out, a female voice hollered up to the window.  She asked what we were doing.  I jumped back from the window and told G what was up.  We said fuck it, we had come too far to turn back now so we kept on bending the beam. We didn’t realize that she was a deputy outside doing a perimeter check.  Within two minutes, a squad car was outside flashing a light up to the window.   “Damn, this is fucked up,” I said as I turned toward the rest of the crew.  My heart sunk down into my shower shoes when I realized we weren’t going to be getting out of county jail that night.   “Man, we might as well go back to our cells,” someone said somberly. We looked around at each other, then agreed to go back to our cells.  Before I got back to my cell, I realized that we had left the pipe in the dayroom so I ran back, grabbed the pipe, and threw it out of the window before rushing back to my cell.  I knew the deputies would be rushing the rock at any minute so I did everything I could to remove any evidence that I had been out of the cell.  I removed the socks from my shower shoes, shook the glass out, took off my extra T-shirt, and then jumped on my bunk.  I pulled the scratchy, wool blanket over my head and did my best to play sleep.  I was sweating profusely, but I had no immediate plans to come up from under the covers.   It took the deputies at least twenty minutes to finally figure out what rock the escape attempt had occurred on.  It felt like the longest wait in my life.  I could hear my heart beating and I was sure that the deputies would hear it echoing through the dayroom when they opened the door.  Finally, a bright light washed over the room as they turned on all of the lights. A sergeant barked out orders as the deputies went cell by cell snatching us all out.  They slammed us up against the wall and forced us to strip naked in the middle of the dayroom.  They threatened to beat our asses and bust our heads with flashlights if we didn’t come clean.  I imagined in my head that when I turned around, there would be several men standing with their fingers pointing at me, G, Gigolo and Jabo.  But when I turned around, I realized how well we had concealed our identity because everyone appeared to be confused.  They didn’t know who or how many of us had tried to escape.  The fact that no one said anything seemed to infuriate the deputies and they tore through our cells like human tornadoes.  They threw our pictures, letters, and commissary into the middle of the dayroom floor along with our mattresses.  Lucky for us, their emotional reaction resulted in no charges.  They had contaminated the scene of the crime, and now every inmate present had glass particles on their property.  When one of the captains realized their error, he ordered us back into our cells; however, it was too late, the damage had been done.   They told us that we would be on lockdown until they got to the bottom of what happened.  It was this threat that led someone to rat us out.  There was one other guy who was supposed to go with us, but he backed out at the last minute.  He was the person we suspected had given us up because he was the only other guy who knew of our plot.  The reason I won’t mention his name is because I can’t prove that he ratted on us.  My gut and street intuition tells me that he did, but I will never label a person a rat unless I have undeniable proof that he told.  To me, that’s one of the ugliest labels you can place on a person so I am very careful about using it.  We were allowed to collect our belongings before they finally locked the rock down at about five o’clock in the morning.   I laid back on the bunk and fought back tears of defeat.  I had never wanted for anything so bad in my life.  I thought about Brenda having to go it alone and my heart crumbled like a graham cracker pie crust as I thought about serving a long prison sentence.  It was in that moment that the gravity of my situation hit me.  Up to that point, I hadn’t made any preparation for being away from my family and friends.  I also hadn’t stopped for one minute to think about the victim of my crime or his family.  I was wrapped up in a delusional state of selfishness and self-denial.  I was sick and didn’t even realize it until years later.   A few hours later, the deputies returned to our rock and headed straight for Gigolo’s cell.  They cuffed him and his bunky and escorted them off of the rock.  I stood at my window listening in an effort to see what was going on.  Initially, I thought they were doing something routine since they had his bunky.  Moments later, they came to my cell and told me to step out.  They cuffed me and told me that I was being placed in the hole and charged with attempted escape.  They boxed up the rest of my belongings and escorted me off of the rock.  The deputies took me through a tunnel to the old side of the county jail where the hole was located.  When I reached the rock, they took me to a cell and tossed my belongings in before ordering me to step inside.  They then removed the cuffs and told me that the hearings officer would be through to see me along with an officer from Internal Affairs.   Gigolo called down the tier and asked who they had just brought in.  I told him it was me.  We talked for a minute and found out that they had told him the same thing.  Moments later, G was brought down to the hole.  We acknowledged out loud that we hadn’t done anything, just in case they were listening or had a plant in our presence.  We agreed that we would demand a lawyer when questioned and stand mute when we went to their internal court.  Our strategy proved effective and we were never charged with the attempt to escape.  However, we were found guilty in their kangaroo court and sentenced to fifteen days in the hole.  The days in the hole went by slowly.  I spent most of the time lying on the floor peering through the cracked window facing Gratiot where cars drove by all day with their sounds bumping loudly.  If I wasn’t doing that, I watched the roaches crawl down the tier as we talked about different aspects of life.  Sometimes we would sit back and recite the verses of rap songs that we loved or kick it about our childhoods.  It was through these stories that I learned of the years of childhood abuse and neglect that the other men had suffered.  We were all wounded boys with deep psychological and emotional scars.  We all came from homes were ass whoopings were the norm and vile words were handed out like candy to trick-or-treaters on Halloween.  We weren’t bad people, but we had all made some very bad decisions in response to the bad things we experienced in life.  We were fathers, brothers, uncles, drug dealers, robbers and killers.  We weren’t all of one thing, but a mixture of failure, neglect, promise and purpose.  Sadly, we would all grow to live our adulthood out in prisons across the state with varied experiences.   One week later, I was returned to court and sentenced to serve 17 to 40 years of my life in prison. Chapter 7 “The police are outside,” John warned, moments before the sound of loud banging reverberated through the house.  I rushed down the stairs to see what was going on.  John was known for being paranoid and raising false alarms, so I wanted to see what was up before I made any drastic decisions about getting rid of the crack. When I looked out of the front window, I noticed two squad cars and decided to get rid of everything before they kicked in the door.   The police continued beating on the door while I gathered all of the rocks and threw them down the heat vent located in the dining room.  I wasn’t sure where they would end up, but I knew for certain that the police wouldn’t get them.  Finally, John opened the door and they rushed into the house with their guns raised.  They didn’t have a search warrant for the premises and I am unsure if they asked John for his permission to enter.  Little did I know, it would not be the last time my Constitutional rights were trampled on.  Sadly, for most of the young Black males in our community, there is no expectation of protection by the Constitution.  When it comes to our interaction with the police, we are not given the same respect that other citizens receive.  It is not uncommon for police to brutalize us and violate our Constitutional rights under the guise of crime prevention. When the police entered the house, they told John that someone had called and informed them that a homicide had been committed.  They told us that one of the neighbors witnessed a shooting in the backyard and they were out to investigate.  John assured them that no one had been shot or killed, but that didn’t stop them from rummaging through the house.  It was clear from the set up of the house that we were running a drug operation.  In addition to the Armor Guard, the house had the usual signs of a drug den.  The living room table was strewn with leftover Coney Island and bottles of warm Old English 800 malt liquor with cigarette butts floating around in them.  Piles of unwashed clothes sat in the corner next to a row of gym shoes and the basement was full of customers who were clueless to what was going on upstairs.  A few officers went back outside and entered the basement through the side door.  I heard a lot of commotion followed by piercing screams as they went to work beating our customers.  A middle-aged Black officer and a young White officer ushered me, John and one of the older homies named Lee into the dining room.  I was calm at first because I knew I had gotten rid of all the dope; however, when I heard the screams coming from the basement, my hands began shaking like a pair of dice at a crap game.  I had no desire to experience whatever they were getting that had them screaming as though they were on the verge of death.  We were ordered to place our hands on the wall in front of us.  The young White officer searched the living room and dining room before turning his attention to us.  He patted Lee down and took all of the money he had in his pocket.  Lee protested and showed him his check stub.  The officer returned Lee’s money and told him to sit on the floor facing the wall.  He then came over to me and asked me where the dope was stashed as he patted me down.  He searched my pockets, then stuck his hand in my waistband and pulled them away from my body so that he could see if I had anything stashed in my underwear.  Without provocation, he punched me in my stomach.  It felt like someone had sucked all of the air out of my body.  I grabbed my nuts and slumped to the floor where I lay still while he retrieved money from my pocket.   “Tell me where the dope at!” the Black officer said with a smirk on his face as they counted the money they had taken out of my pockets.   I was in too much pain to respond and what I wanted to say would have cost me another beat down.  In that moment, what little respect I had for the police was lost. Whether I was doing right or wrong, they had no right to beat me.  They were supposed to be there to uphold the law and lead by example, but instead they proved to be worse than us.   Switching tactics, the officers asked me where I had gotten the money.  I told them from my uncle.  They told me that I was lying, then snatched me up from the floor and slammed my face into the wall.  I braced my fragile body for the barrage of blows that I expected they would deliver, but instead of beating me more, they placed me in handcuffs and told me they were taking me in for loitering in a suspected drug house.   As they escorted me out of the house, they asked where I lived.  I gave them my mother’s address as they threw me in the back of the squad car.  I took in the view of my neighborhood as we rode the short distance to my street.  For the first time in my life, I noticed the subtle nuances and beautiful architecture of the buildings in my neighborhood as the people we passed appeared in vivid colors.  Something about being held captive heightened my senses, and the reality of what I was doing with my life started hitting me.   When the officers pulled up in front of our house, all of my neighbors came out.  Some of them wore disappointed expressions and others had that “here we go again” look on their faces.  There were even a few who had smirks on their faces as though they were getting some sick satisfaction from seeing me cause my parents such grief and embarrassment.  Looking back, I can only imagine what those times were like for my father.  My mother wasn’t home, but my father was there.  The officers uncuffed me and walked me into the house where they talked with my father for a few minutes.  In his presence, they were polite and professional.  They told him that they found me hanging out in a drug house and I had a lot of money in my possession.  They never mentioned how they beat my ass, and when I told my father what happened, he looked at me like I deserved it.  To this day, it troubles me that we allow these abuses to go unchecked.  No matter the circumstances, police abuse is never okay.  Finally, they told my father that they would turn the money they confiscated in to evidence, but I knew that was some bullshit.  I didn’t know the law at the time, but I knew enough about life to know that we would never see those officers or that money again.  It was one of the many lessons that I would learn about the officers who police the ‘hood.  Most of them were no different from us; they were opportunists, and when they saw a chance to get over, they took it.  I’m not saying that all officers are crooked, but my experience in the ‘hood has led me to be distrustful of the men and women in blue.   I stayed at my mother’s house for a couple of weeks before I fell back into my old patterns. Since I had had a taste of the streets and the feeling of being independent, things were different.  I had grown accustomed to coming and going as I pleased.  I was used to living by my own rules, eating what I wanted, getting up when I felt like it, and going to sleep when my body and mind were too tired to stay awake.  Going back to my mother’s house, I knew these were things she would never tolerate.  I tried to straddle the fence between the streets and her house, but it was nearly impossible.   The day after the police took me home, I went back around to the spot.  I sold rocks during the day and came home late at night.  I could sense that my late night antics were rubbing my mother the wrong way.  She had a rule about being in her house at a reasonable hour, which meant we had to be home by the time she got in bed.  It didn’t matter how old you were, she didn’t play that running in and out of the house at all hours of the night.  She tried to deal with it for the first week or so.  I think she kind of understood what I was going through, but was unable to handle it.  We never talked about why I had left in the first place, and we never sought counseling as a family, so we did a precarious dance around the big elephant in the room until our feet got tangled up.  Two weeks into my return home, things came to a head and I left for the last time.   Meanwhile, the spot on Wilshire was banging.  We sold thousands of dollars worth of rocks every day.  Everyone in the crew was making money.  We would ride up to Royal Skateland in Miko’s Wrangler and Grand AM with the music blaring.  We would all get out in our Fila suits with our pockets bulging, dancing and talking shit like we owned the ‘hood.  The girls flocked to us and the guys wanted to be us.  The older girls doted on me and told me how good I looked, and I ate it up like Thanksgiving dinner.  We were addicted to the life, and like any other addiction, we were always looking for ways to make it more exciting.  Sometimes we would hit Belle Isle and hang outside of the rides with the music blaring as we sipped on Old English and smoked weed.  But that wasn’t enough excitement, and in a matter of months, we raised the stakes.  Our crew had expanded, and a few of the guys had started getting high on fifty-ones.  I resisted the temptation for a while.  I had just started drinking and smoking weed on a regular basis, and I wasn’t trying to take it any further than that because I had watched a few of my guys fall off.  They stopped caring about making money and there primary focus was on getting high.  There were a few who were able to manage their addiction, however, and that’s how I got sucked into the quicksand of crack addiction.  One day, Lee came over to the spot on Wilshire to hang out with me and Tee.  We knew that Tee was smoking so we never allowed him to keep the sack, but I didn’t know that Lee was also smoking laced joints until I caught him.  I had gone upstairs to use the bathroom when I noticed Lee sitting in the master bedroom on the bed.  When I came closer, I saw that he was crushing up a rock and mixing it with a small pile of weed.  When he noticed me, he played like it wasn’t a big deal.  He told me that it wasn’t like smoking the pipe because the weed absorbed the effects of the cocaine.   Lee was the epitome of the manipulative older homie.  Sadly, many of our young men grow up looking up to the older homies in the ‘hood because they make them believe that they have their best interests at heart. When things aren’t going good at home, they have all of the answers.  When these guys don’t have anywhere to live, they show them how to hustle and take care of themselves.  In reality, they are the worst predators on our community.  Anyone who will encourage a child to sell or use drugs is sick in the head and a danger and threat to the health of the community.  Sadly, most of the guys I know serving long prison sentences for drugs and violent crimes were introduced to the game by one of the older guys in the ‘hood.  What I didn’t know is that no matter how you smoke crack, it is highly addictive and deadly.  I watched Lee as he lit up the laced joint.  The joint crackled, and I could see the oil from the cocaine burning through the paper.  The thick plume of white smoke smelled sickly sweet and the effect on Lee was instantaneous.  He inhaled again deeply before passing me the joint with a nod.  I took it and held it in my hand for a minute before he encouraged me to take a hit.  I put it to my lips and sucked the devil’s poison into my young lungs.  It felt evil going down and I knew something wasn’t right.  My heart began beating erratically and my lips grew numb.  My whole body felt higher than it had ever felt, and I thought my heart was going to burst out of my shirt.  My hearing became crystal clear and my conscience began to fuck with me.  All of the shit that I had been doing wrong began to play tricks on me.  I was paranoid; I thought that my mother would appear at the door any minute with a belt in her hand to whoop my ass. Lee assured me that what I was feeling was normal.  I went to look out of the window about ten times, checking for the police.  After a while, the effects began subsiding.  Tee joined us and we smoked a few more laced joints.  I paid for them out of the money that I was going to make off of the sack that I was selling.  By the end of the night, we had smoked up all of the profit from that sack.  I called Miko to get another sack, and while I waited for him, I grew more paranoid.  I thought he could tell I was high just from our phone conversation.  I thought about everything he had told me over the past few months.  He had warned me to never smoke crack, and it was like he was sitting on my shoulder whispering in my ear.  When he finally showed up, I was really tripping.    Lee and Tee were acting all skittish and paranoid, and it affected me.  I picked up on their vibe and began feeling uncomfortable.  I thought to myself, “I’m never smoking that shit again in my life,” but I knew I was lying to myself.  A few days later, we ended up smoking some more, and then it became a regular thing.  At first, we would just pay for it out of our own pockets; however, there was no way that what we earned in a day could keep pace with the addictive influence of the laced joints.  Between the three of us, we were smoking over a thousand dollars worth of rocks a day.   I didn’t even notice how fast I was going downhill.  By the end of the day, the money I had hustled for went up in a cloud of bluish-white smoke.  Within a few weeks, I was fucking up the sacks.  I would cut some of the rocks or claim that the sacks Miko gave me were short.  My fourteen-year-old world was spinning out of control.  Around this time, I was also working a spot on a street named Maiden right off of Conners.  It was a two-family flat and we rolled out of the downstairs flat.  It was a decent looking house, and the couple who lived there was cool.  They had a son who was a couple of years younger than me, but they didn’t appear to be bothered by the fact that I was selling out of their house.  One day, I hooked up with one of their nephews who smoked laced joints.  He was in his early twenties and used to sell crack for the Best Friends. We clicked instantly and stayed up all night smoking laced joints.  Together we decided that we were going to run off with the next sack that Miko dropped off, which was worth a thousand dollars.   Once we got the sack from Miko, we chilled with some people that the guy knew and smoked all day.  I didn’t know anyone there, but they had no problem taking advantage of all the crack I had with me.  Once all of the rocks were gone and my high had subsided, I realized that I didn’t have anywhere to go but back to the ‘hood. I spent the day trying to duck Miko, but there was no getting away from the ‘hood.  When he caught up with me, he was in the car with two of his goons and he ordered me to get in the car.  I thought about taking off running, but decided against it.  I was quick on my feet and had a ready response to his question about the dope and my whereabouts.  I lied and told him that the spot had been raided and I had been taken to the youth home.  I even told him that he could take me around to my mother’s house and ask her because she was the one who had gotten me out that morning.  I didn’t anticipate that he would take me up on my offer, but to my surprise, he put the car in drive and sped off toward my mother’s house.  I sat in the back of the car nervous because I knew that my mother had no idea what was going on in my life.  When we reached the block, I didn’t have the nerve to go through with it.  I didn’t know what they would do to my mother, and I wasn’t about to jeopardize my family because of my bullshit, so I told Miko that I had smoked up the sack.  He was really fucked up about it because he had known for a while that the other guys were fucking around, but he never suspected that I would be the one to go out like that.  I was still a child and it never occurred to him that I would be gone off of that shit.  His goons didn’t seem too surprised and were very eager to make an example out of me.  They didn’t care about my age or my size.  They were street-hardened veterans who no longer felt empathy.   There are very few people who know about this part of my life or this side of the game.  Like many who fall prey to addiction, I was in denial.  I thought that I could handle myself and anything that the streets threw my way; however, no child is equipped to deal with the ugly brutality of the streets.  Miko had no choice but to do something because I had fucked over his money.  He was bound by the code of the streets, and he knew that the moment he went against the code and turned soft was the moment he would become the prey in a land of predators.  We drove around in silence for what seemed like hours.  Several times I thought of jumping out of the car and taking off, but I didn’t have a desire to get shot in the back of the head.  Finally, after nearly an hour, we pulled up in front of the house on Maiden.  One of Miko’s goons grabbed me by the back of my shirt and dragged me into the house.  I pleaded with Miko and told him that I would work off the money I had messed up.  Very bluntly, he asked me, “How you gonna work off a sack when you a crackhead?”  His words hit me harder than any of the punches that they threw.  I had in essence become that which I despised and had taken advantage of.  I was a customer and consumer of the poison I had once took pride in selling to others.  I was the scorn of the dope game and my word meant nothing.   As soon as we got into the living room, Miko turned around and punched me in the face.  I staggered backwards, and before I could regain my composure, one of his goons punched me in the back of the head.  I swung on one of his goons and did my best to fight back.  I never swung at Miko, but I didn’t care about scrapping with his goons.  Despite my best efforts, my adolescent strength was no match for their adult strength.  They quickly overpowered me and administered a thorough beat down.  After beating me down until I was lying in a pool of blood, Miko stopped them.  My nose was bleeding profusely and one side of my face was swollen.  It was hard for me to breathe, and as I lay there, I thought I was going to die.  When they were finished with me, Miko told me to get up from the floor.  He told me to clean myself up and wait at the house for them to come back. I was dazed and confused.  I looked at his goons and thought about the rifle that was in the back room, but I didn’t have the heart at the time to shoot anyone.   Despite the fact that I had smoked up the sack, I felt betrayed by Miko.  I looked up to him like a big brother, but when it came down to it, I was nothing more than a laborer.  I knew he had held back and didn’t allow them to hurt me the way they had done other guys, but it didn’t take away from the scars to my psyche.  The way I saw it, if Miko could turn on me, then anyone could turn on me, and in that moment, I made a silent vow to kill the next motherfucker who put his hands on me.  I stared at myself in the mirror for a few minutes as I thought about what my next move would be.  I felt lonely and vulnerable.  My lips were swollen and cracked, and my eye had a lump the size of a plumb beneath it.  As much as I wanted to, I could no longer cry.  My feelings grew colder by the minute as I thought about revenge.  I didn’t know what to do or where to turn, and I was afraid that Miko and his goons would return at any minute and finish beating me until I died.  As that thought crossed my mind, I looked around the bathroom for something to defend myself with in the event they came after me again.  After a few minutes, I heard them exiting the house and a wave of relief came over me.  I slumped down on the bathroom floor and curled myself up into a tight ball.   Thoughts of my mother and father tumbled through my mind.  I thought about everything they had told me about God and how none of it made sense in that moment.  I cursed their blond-haired, blue-eyed God.  How could God allow this to happen to me, I wondered.  Where were the caring, protective arms of Jesus when I needed him?  Where were my mother and father while I was lying on the pissy bathroom floor of a crackhouse?  The sound of someone coming from upstairs caused me to pull myself up from the floor.  My face was throbbing, and each time I took a breath, it felt like I had been stabbed in my side.  I stood in front of the sink and rinsed the blood from my mouth with cold water, then I heard a soft voice asking if I was alright.  I looked up and nodded my head indicating that I was okay.  Sharon, who lived upstairs with her one-year-old son, looked at me with pity as she grabbed a face cloth and washed my face with cold water.  She was the niece of the guy whose house we were selling out of, and from the moment I started selling out of their house, her and I had gotten cool.  She was beautiful and I had a little crush on her, but she looked at me like a little brother.  She told me that I needed to get out of the game and leave Miko alone.  As she talked, I felt a deep sense of shame and embarrassment overtake me.    I wasn’t sure if she knew that I had smoked up their crack, or if she had seen me get my ass beaten.  Whatever the case, I knew that I never wanted to see her again.  She told me to come upstairs when I got myself together so that she could talk to me.  I told her that I would, but deep inside I knew it would be the last time I saw her.  When I gathered myself, I walked the short distance to my Uncle Keith’s house.  He lived several streets over on Chelsea.  He was street savvy and all of the guys in the ‘hood looked up to him.  I was set on revenge and thought he would understand.  I was thinking irrationally, but back then that didn’t matter to me.  All I knew was that I wanted to get back at Miko for what he had done to me. When my uncle saw me and heard what happened, he jumped into his Jeep and drove around the neighborhood looking for Miko.  When we couldn’t catch up with him, we returned to his house.  He asked me what was going on with me, and I gave him a modified version that didn’t include me smoking laced joints.  He told me that I was heading down the wrong path and needed to go home.  I understood where he was coming from, but returning home was no longer an option for me.  I stayed the night at my uncle’s, and the following day, he dropped me off at my oldest sister Tamica’s house on Margaret and John R.  When Tamica saw my face, she started crying.  She wanted to go find Miko and beat his ass.  We grew up fighting side-by-side with each other.  No matter who she got into with, I was right there and vice versa.  When she calmed down, we talked about what happened and she told me that I could stay with her.  After months of surviving on my own in the streets, I had a chance to start anew.  My oldest brother Alan was on his way home from prison and it looked like we would be able to put our family back together.   With Alan’s arrival home, my older brother Art started coming back around and the three of us hung out together nearly every day.  Before long, we were all deeply entrenched in the drug trade and the pathological behavior of the drug trade became deeply entrenched in us.  The real war on drugs had just begun, and it played itself out within our family, leaving behind many casualties. Chapter 8 \t The night before I was sentenced, I stayed up pacing the floor.  I thought about everything I had gone through that led me to that moment.  I pictured the people and the incidents that shaped my worldview.  I thought about everything I had missed out on and all that I would miss out on.  I never went to my prom or walked across the stage at graduation.  I thought about my younger sisters, Nakia and Shamica, who were 16 and 10 when I got arrested.  I wouldn’t be there to protect them from neighborhood boys, or watch them graduate. I thought about Brenda and the struggles she was about to face trying to raise our child alone.  I knew she didn’t have the family support that she needed to raise a baby in a healthy household. I talked to Gigolo, G, White Boy and Jabo until they were ready to go to sleep.  They wished me luck and told me that they would pray for the judge to be lenient.  Finally, at 3am, the deputy came to get me.  He cuffed me and led me to the elevator where a few other guys were waiting to go to court.  We were all at different stages of the process so our outlooks were different.  Some still held out hope that they would beat their case, and others, like myself, were preparing themselves for life upstate. \tWhen we reached the bullpen, I saw a few familiar faces from the ‘hood, but I wasn’t in the mood to talk to anyone.  Every time a door opened and closed, I thought about my chances of fleeing to freedom, but I knew there was no way I would make it, so I prepared to take my sentence like a man.   \tI carried a picture of me and Brenda with me to the bullpen outside of the courtroom.  While I sat on the bench waiting for my name to be called, I stared at our picture until my thoughts were interrupted by a guy who had just entered the bullpen.  He told me he recognized Brenda, and initially I got pissed off.  Reading my reaction, he quickly explained that he grew up down the street from her and used to run with her uncle.  We talked for a minute until our attention was drawn to a light-skinned guy with a long ponytail who had just come into the bullpen.  “What do y’all think the judge will do to a man serving a life sentence if he raped another guy,” he asked out loud as he looked around the room for an answer. A few guys replied that there wasn’t much the judge could do if the guy was already serving a life sentence.  After taking in their answers, he told them that he was the guy he was referring to.  Before he could finish his sentence, I knew he was the guy that my bunky had told me about.  He didn’t look like he was capable of raping another man, or at least that wasn’t the vision of Seven that I had in my mind.  In my mind, I imagined a brute foaming at the mouth with scars everywhere and a menacing baldhead, but he was just the opposite.  The guy I had been talking to from the neighborhood appeared to be irritated and told him to get the fuck away from him talking that gay shit.  Seven laughed, then went and sat next to a White guy who was sitting on the bench.  The guy from the ‘hood told me that he had done a bit before and couldn’t stand the sexual predators that he encountered during his bid.  He said that most of them were weak and only preyed on the weak White boys.  I took it all in as I watched Seven talking to the White guy.  I could tell from his body language that he was up to something, but it wasn’t my business.  I had my own problems to deal with at the time, so I sat back and waited for them to call my name.  A few minutes passed, and I was called to stand before Judge Robert Evans for sentencing.  When I entered the courtroom, I saw my parents, Brenda, and my ex-girlfriend Nycci from Ohio.  I smiled at them but my heart was cracked in half.  I quickly turned back around to face the judge who reminded me of my grandfather.   I didn’t know what to expect at the sentencing.  My lawyer assured me and my family that I was looking at no more than ten years.  It was his assurance that led me to take a plea.  While I wasn’t excited about doing the next ten years in prison, I knew it was a good deal.  Most of the guys I had talked to on the rock told me that it was in my best interests to take the plea because the charge itself carried a life sentence.  We had all seen guys get sentenced to 40, 50 and 60 years for similar charges.  While ten years wasn’t anything to sneeze at, it sounded better then fifty years of life in prison.   Finally, after a short wait, I was called up for sentencing.  My lawyer wasn’t present so I agreed to allow his partner, Gerald Evelyn, to represent me at the sentencing.  We talked briefly and he told me what to do when the judge questioned me about the plea.  I had a GED and did well whenever I went to school, but I wasn’t able to fully grasp the subtleties of the law as it applied to my plea agreement.  It was my understanding that my lawyer had already gotten me a deal for ten years, so when I approached the bench, I was surprised to learn that there was no pre-existing sentence agreement in place.  That meant I was taking a risk and could be sentenced to any number of years, including life.  I didn’t fully understand at that moment that I could have withdrawn my plea and proceeded with a trial.   There were so many emotions and thoughts running through my head that it was impossible for me to think straight.  In many ways, I was still a child, and everything about the system was intimidating, so I went along with the program.  Finally, after asking me about the case, the Judge said he was ready to sentence me.  He asked me if I had anything to say and I told him I did.  I apologized to the victim’s family and asked them to forgive me for what I had done to their loved one.  I then asked the Judge for leniency.  After I was done speaking, he looked down at what I now know were the sentencing guidelines to determine how much time he was going to give me.  When he finished with his calculations, he told me that I would be sentenced to serve a total of seventeen to forty years in prison.  When the numbers leapt from his mouth, my knees buckled.  I was only two years past the age of seventeen and had hardly begun to live.  I couldn’t even comprehend the thought of spending nearly two decades of my life behind bars.  My shoulders slumped forward as I lowered my head.  I could hear my mother and Brenda crying behind me, but I was too afraid to turn around and face them.  I knew if I turned back, I would break down.  Instead, I turned and walked toward the door leading me back to the bullpen.  When I stepped into the bullpen, everyone grew quiet.  I sat back down on the bench where I had left my bag and rested my head against the wall.  My eyes felt like they were going to burst at any moment.  Slowly, I started shutting my mind down.  I had turned my back on everything that I thought would make me happy in life.  I no longer wanted to think of the things that used to be; I had a bid to do, and I knew I couldn’t afford the distraction of looking back.   Really, there was nothing to look back for.  The way I saw it, seventeen years later, none of those things would be the same.  Whenever they released me, I would be starting my life over from scratch.  All I had shared with the people in my life would be no more.  As I sat there deleting the files from my past, my lawyer called me to the visiting booth.  He told me about my appeal and my rights.  He may as well had been explaining to me how to build the Great Wall of China.  His words were empty to me and meant nothing.  My sadness was slowly replaced by a deep, dark anger that caused my body to grow tense and hard.   I was thankful that no one in the bullpen asked me any questions, because in that moment, I know I would have been facing another charge.  After waiting a few more minutes, I noticed Seven luring a White guy into the small bathroom area inside the bullpen. Evil and perversity dripped from his pores like sweat and it sickened me to think that I would be spending the next seventeen years of my life around such depraved men. Moments later, the guards came to get me.  They returned me to the hole where I had been for the last week or so.  When I hit the rock, Gigolo called down and asked me what happened.  It told him how much time the judge had given me, and he got quiet.  I knew he was thinking about his own chances at sentencing.  We had all rolled the street dice and crapped out.  A few of the guys asked me how I felt and I told them that I was alright, but that was as far from the truth as Detroit is from Alaska.  I was beyond hurt.  I couldn’t stop thinking about the two children I would be leaving behind.  My life wasn’t supposed to be spent behind bars, but I had given up on life and now I had to pay the price.  That was the hardest part for me.  I didn’t want to own up to what I had done and this only made matters worse. Two days after I was sentenced, I was transferred upstate to prison.  My first stop was Riverside Correctional Facility where they quarantined all prisoners under the age of twenty-one.  We took a battery of psychological, behavioral and physical tests to determine what facility we would be shipped to.  They also determined our educational and security needs.   I was herded into the back of a van along with ten other inmates.  The ride from Detroit to Ionia was about two and a half hours long and we barely spoke to each other the entire ride.  We were all lost in our own thoughts of freedom.  We sat in the back with our heads lowered as the van whisked us away from the city.  For two and a half hours, I stared at the handcuffs, hoping they would disappear and I would be set free.  But no matter how hard I thought or imagined, those handcuffs weren’t going anywhere.   When we finally pulled up to the prison, my heart started pounding.  The concertina-wired fences were menacing.  They looked like they were hungry for tender flesh.  The fall sun beamed off of the metal, making them come alive as we circled the parking lot.  Finally, we pulled through a checkpoint in front of the prison.  The deputies checked their pistols before they got out of the van, then came around to the back.  They ordered us out as they held their pistols tightly.  We shuffled off of the van and stretched our legs out before we were led inside the building.  We watched as the deputies checked their pistols in with the correction officer behind the desk.  Once they had met all of the security requirements, we were finally led inside of the prison.  One of the things that I noticed when we pulled up was how neatly manicured the lawns were and how new the buildings looked.  The prison stood in stark contrast to the dilapidated schools that sat like scabs across Detroit’s decaying landscape.  It wasn’t until years later that I understood the politics of it all.  The state was more willing to invest money in the upkeep of prisons than they were in schools.  They had it all backwards.  Instead of treating the disease, they spent millions of dollars treating the symptoms.  Looking at the buildings was also a reminder of what the bigwig politicians really thought of the Black community; we were disposable.  In reality, we were being set up to fail.  The intake process was similar to what we went through when we entered the county jail.  We were forced to strip out of our personal clothes and dressout in state blues.  We were given a box to send out whatever pictures, books, and clothes we had brought with us from the county jail.  We stood around ass naked in front of more people than I had ever known in my entire nineteen years on earth.  Through this slow, gradual process, I started becoming detached from my own body.  I no longer felt like I belonged to myself.  I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was being turned into chattel for the state.   In order to keep from going insane, I learned to detach my emotions from the experience, with the exception of anger.  I held on to the anger because that was the only time I felt like I had control over my life, even though I would later discover that I was giving them the little control I had left whenever I lashed out in anger.  We were called up one-by-one to the desk where an officer waited.  We went through the whole bend and cough process again, then we were given a number.  “Mr. James Angelo White, please step forward,” the officer said. When I stepped up to the desk, she asked me my name.  I gave it to her, then she told me that my new name was prisoner number 219184.  She urged me to remember that number like I had remembered my own name.  I thought about her words as I stepped to the next window to retrieve my state-issued clothing.  I slipped into the blues and went to sit on the bench where a few more guys were waiting. When the last guy was dressed out, we were taken to building seven where we were given our cell assignments.  The officer told us to take our bedrolls down to our cells and report back to the dayroom in five minutes.  When I went down the hall, I was expecting to see a cell with bars, but instead it was a small room with a single bunk, small desk, and a big steel door.  In the back of the cell, there was a window with a few panes of glass missing.  It was still early in the evening, but I could feel the cool, fall air blowing through as soon as I entered the cell.  I placed my bedroll on the hard, green, plastic mattress.  I then returned to the dayroom where the rest of the guys waited.  The officer led us around to the infirmary where we were given a physical exam.  They checked to see if we needed glasses or any other medical equipment to stay alive.  They also checked our blood pressure and pulse, and then told us that they were going to test us for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.  Back then, HIV was relatively new, and most of what we had heard on the streets was distorted and void of truth.  We sat around joking about the disease, feeding into the myth that it was only for gay White men.  We didn’t feel like we had a reason to be concerned.   When I entered the examination room, I told the nurse that I didn’t need the HIV test because I had never used IV drugs or had sex with men.  She laughed at my ignorance before setting me straight.  She asked if I had ever had unprotected sex.  I told her yes, with a little swagger in my voice.  She told me that if I had ever had unprotected sex, then I could have contracted it.  She explained that there were no visible signs that a woman had HIV.  She said that a woman could be as pretty as Phylicia Rashad and still be carrying the virus that caused AIDS.   The more she explained the disease to me, the more I thought about the women that I had had unprotected sex with.  A parade of naked women danced through my head, but not in a good way.  I was very promiscuous from the time I turned fourteen.  I could count on one hand how many times I had worn a condom and had been burned four times.  As she drew my blood, I watched carefully to see if there were any traces of HIV in it.  I don’t know what I was looking for, but if I had seen anything, I would have freaked out.  She finally told me that she wouldn’t have results for a couple of weeks.  That was the longest wait ever.   Once we were done, we returned to our cells and the officer told us to get our cells together.  I went in, made up my bed, and lay down until we were called a half hour later.  We were taken down to a large room where we went through orientation.  The officer told us how prison worked and what to do and not to do.  He gave us a rulebook and told us if we violated the rules, we would be locked down in our cells, or placed in the hole if we did anything serious.  He told us to never gamble, borrow money, or engage in homosexual sex.  He also cautioned us against playing basketball.  He said that all of these things were hotbeds for conflict.  He then told us that some of us would do easy time, others would mess up and get in a bunch of trouble, and some wouldn’t make it at all.  He was vague in what he meant, but over the course of time I would learn exactly what he was talking about.  Once we were done, we were returned back to our cells.  This time, the door was locked behind us and we were told that they were about to do count.  A few minutes later, an officer came by and looked in my cell before writing something on a long sheet of paper.  I learned later that that was how they kept up with us and made sure none of us escaped.  When the officer left my door, I went to the window at the back of the cell and stared out into the darkening sky.  I felt a deep sadness grab me as I thought about how bad I had messed up my life.  I started talking to God and asking him how he had allowed this to happen to me.  I couldn’t make any sense of the deep pit of darkness I had fallen into.  Every bad thing that ever happened to me came floating back as I stared out at the sky. I started feeling sorry for myself, and then started getting angry with God, my parents, my teachers and everyone else I felt had let me down.  I felt unlovable and thought that no one cared enough to find out why I had veered so far off the path.  Never once did I stop to think about how much I had let myself down.  I cursed God and my parents.  I didn’t want anything to do with them because I felt like they had given up on me.  As my anger grew, I noticed several alley cats sniffing around a garbage can near the back of what I discovered was the main chow hall for general population prisoners.  In that moment, I would have given anything to be an alley cat.  Reflecting back, I didn’t realize the lesson that was playing out right before my eyes.  For me, prison was a hellish existence, but for the cats, it was a place of refuge and nourishment.  Where I found anger and pain, they found food and shelter.  I now realize that there are all kinds of prisons, and the worst of them, is the prison we erect in our mind.  Moreover, physical prisons can become whatever we want them to be.  A cell can be a graveyard or a sacred space of higher learning; either way, we make a choice.   When count was cleared, we were allowed to come out of our cells and use the bathroom.  That was the first chance I had to see some of the guys who were there before I arrived.  I didn’t know what to expect.  I had seen a few movies about prison and had heard enough stories to last me a lifetime, so I was prepared for anything.  When I stepped out of the cell, there were a few guys hanging out in the doorway of their cells.  We exchanged glances as I walked down the hall.  I didn’t recognize any familiar faces when I entered the bathroom.   A few guys stood around smoking cigarettes and talking to some of the guys who had come in with me.  I didn’t say much to anyone; I had a bid to do and wasn’t in the mood for idle chitchat.  In fact, I was a bit annoyed with the guys who acted like they were having a family reunion when they ran into guys they were with in the county jail.   When I finished handling my business, I returned to my cell.  I was learning to like the solitude that my cell offered.  I stayed up most of the night watching the alley cats and dreaming of getting out of prison.  When I was tired of standing up, I sat on the edge of my bed chain-smoking.  When I finally laid down for the night, I drifted off into a fitful sleep.  I was out for a couple of hours before it was time for breakfast.  The bathroom was overflowing with guys trying to brush their teeth and wash their faces before they went to the chow hall.  There were at least 70 of us trying to share five sinks and three toilets.  From the very beginning, the pecking order was established; the less assertive and weak went last.  Small cliques shared a specific sink and made sure the members of their crew got first access to the sink and toilet.  This tribal behavior extended to the dayrooms, telephones, and basketball courts.  If you were perceived as weak or unworthy of respect, you didn’t have shit coming unless you aligned yourself with someone stronger.  I refused to be taken advantage of or disrespected in any way so I asserted myself from the very beginning.  When a sink opened up, I stepped up and used it without asking for permission.  I wasn’t disrespectful to anyone, but I made it clear that I had just as much right as the next person.  Over the next couple of days, I got a feel for the joint.  The social interaction wasn’t that much different from the ‘hoods I had come up in.  In fact, prisons have become an extension of the ‘hood in a way.  I say this because there aren’t many families in the Black community who haven’t had at least one member of the their family in prison. I ran into a few guys that I knew from the streets.  They weren’t guys I ran with on a daily basis, but we knew each other from school or through mutual friends.  My cousin Shawn’s baby’s father, Raymond, was in the cell across from me.  He was sixteen or seventeen and had just been sentenced to serve natural life in prison.  There was also a guy from the ‘hood named Rock who I went to Cooley with; he was also serving a life sentence.  He had been in quarantine for a month or so and put me up on the prison hustles.  He got me a job as a porter so that I could hang out during the morning and afternoon.  I would go with him to pass out linen to everyone in our unit, which nearly led to a full-scale riot.   One morning, we went to pass out linen to the guys who were locked in the gym.  When we got in the gym, a couple of the guys started talking shit because they felt we were giving them the worst linen.  Rock told them to quit crying, they shouldn’t be worried about it because they were doing short time.  They insisted that we were treating the other guys in the cells better than them and acted like they wanted to fight.  I remained quiet for most of the discussion, but my anger was simmering.  Most of the guys in the gym would be back on the streets in a year or less and they were bitching about some fucking linen while we were thinking about how we were going to get through the next fifteen or twenty years in prison.  I snapped and told them to quit crying and shut the fuck up before we wrapped their asses up in some sheets.  A few more guys who locked in the cells with me and Rock came in the gym to see what was up.  When the guys in the gym realized how serious we were, they laid back, but the tension was still there.  A few days later, a fight broke out between one of our guys and a guy who had been in the gym.   By the third week, I had met a few guys from other cities and we all got cool.  We talked to each other about how we were going to do our time when we got to the Michigan Reformatory (MR), which is where most of us figured we were headed.  A few guys started acting out based on what they thought they were supposed to do in prison.  There were guys who pressured the White guys to buy them stuff out of the store and others who started carrying shanks made out of sharpened toothbrushes.  I continued to do my own time.  Every now and then, I would stand around kicking it with the rest of the fellas, but most of the time I would just listen to their stories.  I didn’t want to talk about life on the streets.  It was still too painful for me to think back to those days.   One day, we were all standing outside smoking cigarettes when a guy named Shorty came out and said he had something to tell us.  He was excited and acted like he couldn’t wait to let us know what was up.  He was doing about a year and a half and was one of the guys who wanted to fit in with our crowd.  I tolerated him when he came around, but he wasn’t the kind of person that I enjoyed being around.  I didn’t like people who felt that they had to be something other than what they were in order to be accepted.  Finally, after a few more guys stepped up closer, Shorty started speaking. “Y’all want to get y’all dick sucked?” he asked with a smile. We all looked at each other like, “I know this motherfucker ain’t just ask to suck our dicks.”  I guess he could sense our confusion and rising anger because he started speaking quickly.  “I got this bitch who will suck anybody dick I tell her to,” he said with a confidence that didn’t coincide with what I knew about him.  When he said he had a bitch, the only thing I could think of was one of the female officers who worked at the prison.  I had never observed him speaking to any of them and didn’t peg him as having the type of game to pull a female guard, but my interest had been piqued.  It had been months since I was sexually active.   “What bitch you talking about?” someone asked.  “Y’all ain’t see the new White boy they just rode in?  Man, that bitch a real freak and he said he’d suck anybody dick,” Shorty replied, boasting like he had just told us the slickest shit in the world.  “Nigga is you crazy?  I’m not letting a man suck my dick.  I don’t get down with that gay shit,” I said angrily.  “Don’t ever call me out here for no bitch ass shit like that,” I continued as I prepared to walk back in the building.  Most of the guys in the circle shared the same sentiments.  We all went back inside and talked about what Shorty had just said.  A few of the guys stayed behind, and we later learned, took Shorty up on his offer.  The lines had been quickly drawn.  We made it clear that we weren’t about to become gay just because we were locked up.  Being in prison wasn’t a reason or excuse to change your sexuality.  If you indulged in homosexual behavior, it was because that’s what you wanted to do. Whatever people might think of homosexual behavior, it isn’t as widely accepted in prison as you would imagine.  My circle remained small and I was learning more and more about the kind of people that I didn’t want to be around.  It was hard being alone in prison, but I wasn’t willing to spend my time around people who didn’t share my value system.  I would rather do my time alone than to deal with guys who were fake.  More importantly, I was trying to figure out how to get home to my family.  I was missing everything about being home and tried to connect with my father and Brenda whenever I could.  The first time that I called home and spoke to my father was the hardest.  In the middle of our conversation, he broke down crying and I was at a loss for words. In that moment, I knew I had hurt my father deeply.  I could only imagine what it was like for him having to explain to his friends that his son was in prison and would be gone for nearly two decades. For years, my father blamed himself for me being in prison and I know this was the source of that deep pain that poured through the phone.  He told me that they were going to come up and see me soon, and then we hung up.  I called Georgia and she told me that she was going to bring Brenda up to see me also, so for the next couple of days, I focused on my upcoming visits as I paced my cell floor each night.  During the day, I read whatever novels I could get my hands on.  I had even started reading the Bible.  I focused mostly on those stories that I thought fit my situation like Job’s; however, I wasn’t gaining the sense of peace that I desired so I put the Bible down and focused on the getaway that novels provided.  One day, I was mopping the floor when an officer called me into his office.  He told me to get ready because I had a visit.  I was bursting with excitement as I walked back down to my cell.  I went into the bathroom and freshened up, then headed to the visiting room.  I waited nervously until I was ushered inside.  When I set eyes on Brenda, a deep longing overcame me.  She looked radiant and her smile was beautiful and comforting.  The baby was now showing and she had filled out a little.  We embraced and kissed each other tenderly as though it was our first time.  The familiarity of her taste and the softness of her body pressed against mine made me want to run through the doors with her when she left.  Georgia watched us for a moment, then I hugged her and thanked her for bringing Brenda up.  We finally sat down, and for the first few minutes, I just stared at Brenda without saying anything.  She placed my hand on her stomach when the baby started kicking and I felt a surge of guilt shoot through my body.  She looked so vulnerable and there was nothing I could do to be there for her.   Brenda and Georgia told me what was up on the block.  Georgia was pissed as she talked about how my so-called friends had been playing me.  She told me how they were running around the ‘hood wearing my clothes.  Brenda told me how they had been playing her when it came to the money and drugs I had left behind.  Basically, everyone had flipped.  Instead of being there to help her out, they were out to get over on her.  The more she told me, the more hurt I was.  I had risked my life and sacrificed my freedom for the streets and they were all turning their backs on me.  This was something I would learn was far more common than anyone would like to admit.  But the reality is, there are very few loyal people in the streets.  In fact, most are out for themselves.  It was all good while I was out on the street selling drugs and doing everything to hold down the ‘hood, but as soon as I got locked up, they acted like they didn’t know me.  Over the course of my sentence, I realized that none of them were true friends.  We continued to talk about the baby and its due date.  Brenda said that she wanted to marry me when I came home and assured me that she would always be there for me.  I listened, but emotionally I was shutting down the part of me that would have allowed that to be a possibility.  I knew she wouldn’t be able to handle the pressure of being there for me over the long haul, and I wasn’t about to drive myself insane thinking about it.  I couldn’t bare to tell her what I was feeling.  She was already going through a lot emotionally, so I just sat and listened.  When she left, I never thought it would be the last time I’d see her while I was incarcerated.   Georgia told me that they would come back up in a few weeks if I were still there.  We hugged and kissed and then they were gone.  When I returned to my cell, I stayed up all night looking at the pictures we had taken on the visit.  It was as close as I would ever get to her again on an intimate level.  In those small moments, it was pictures of family and friends that brought me hope and comfort.  The following week, I got a visit from my family.  My father brought my stepmother, stepbrother, two younger sisters and Brenda along with him, but Brenda wasn’t allowed to visit because of an issue with her ID.  My father told me that she was in the lobby crying, but she would be alright.  He said that she told him to tell me she loved me.   We spent the visit talking about my adjustment to prison.  As we talked, I stared at my young siblings and was saddened by their innocence.  I was failing them as a big brother.  I didn’t think about the impact that my behavior had on them until later in my life.  Honestly, I don’t think we’d do some of the things we do in life if we stopped for a minute to think about the impact that our behavior has on the people in our lives.   For the most part, when a person comes to prison, they become fixated on what they’re missing out on in life.  Seldom do we stop to think about what our loved ones miss out on when they visit us, take our calls or send us money.  We don’t think about the wisdom that our younger siblings and children need from us, or the comfort our parents feel in knowing we are home with them.  In reality, prison isn’t just scary for us; it’s scary for them, too.  In fact, it may even be scarier for them because the only point of reference they have is television.  No parent or sibling wants to go to bed every night wondering if their loved one will survive through the night.  During the first years of my incarceration, people from home would always ask me if I was alright.  That seemingly innocent question held a lot of fear, and I understand why.  When someone gets locked up, so does their family. If we realized just how much incarceration impacts our family, we might not put ourselves in situations that could send us to prison.  When my family left, I went back to my cell and stared at their picture as I had done with the picture of me and Brenda.  I didn’t know it then, but I was developing a pattern when it came to visits.  After each visit, I wanted to be alone.  I didn’t want to talk to anyone because I wanted to hold on to every morsel of that visit for as long as I could.  I wanted the smell of my visitors to cling to my nostrils for as long as possible and the feeling of their touch to be a reminder of my humanity.  Most often, I fell asleep not long after I returned from a visit.  I had been in quarantine for a few weeks and knew that my time there was winding down.  A few of the guys who had arrived before me had already been transferred to MR so I started to shift my thoughts in that direction.  While there were some real life prison scenarios playing out at Riverside, I knew they weren’t a real reflection of what to expect.  I had heard horror stories about the Reformatory, which had been dubbed Gladiator School.  It had earned its violent reputation from the daily stabbings that were as much a part of the culture as the horrid slop that they served for chow.  There were a few of us slated to be transferred in the coming week, and the tension began taking its toll on us.  The week before I transferred to MR, me and a few guys got into it with some White guys in the bathroom.  I don’t remember what the conflict was over, but I am sure it was something very petty.  We were all on edge and it didn’t take much to set things in motion.  After a brief argument, we started throwing punches, and then two of the guys ran, leaving the other one behind.  We gave the guy a quick working over and left him lying on the bathroom floor.  Then, two days later, a guy from Inkster, who I had gotten cool with, got stabbed in the head while he was sitting on the toilet taking a dump.  Surprisingly, he didn’t panic.  He got off of the toilet calmly and started kicking the guy’s ass.   Over the next couple of days, the unit buzzed with our volatile exploits.  We were all desensitized to violence and accepted it as the way of the world that we came up in.  In fact, I don’t recall a time when my life wasn’t marred by violence.  From the first time my mother beat me for some minor infraction to the final time I pulled the trigger, violence was a pervasive part of my existence and what I experienced in quarantine was simply a warm-up for things to come. Chapter 9 \t “Oh my God! Alan got shot! Alan got shot!” my sister Tamica screamed at the top of her lungs as she held the cordless phone in her hand.  Tears flowed down her cheeks as she listened to the voice on the other end of the phone.  When she got off of the phone, we bombarded her with questions about our oldest brother’s condition.  I watched my sister’s emotions morph from sadness and fear into a deep, abiding anger.  When she opened her mouth, fire leapt from it as she recounted what she had been told on the phone.  \t“That no-good ass nigga Art shot Alan in the neck and now he’s laying in the hospital with his right side paralyzed.”   The news sucked the air out of the room.  We were in the middle of one of the bloodiest summers in Detroit’s history, but we never thought the violence would come this close to home.  Our brother Art had been accused of shooting our oldest brother Alan.  They had grown up fighting each other like siblings did, but we never thought it would escalate to gunplay. Alan’s shooting marked a turning point in our family.  The bullet that tore through his neck was symbolic of the force of evil known as crack cocaine that was tearing its way through our family.  Prior to the emergence of crack in our community, pistols and handguns weren’t so readily accessible to us.  With the introduction of crack, however, came an influx of guns and gun violence.  My brother Art was never known to carry or use a gun until he got deeply entrenched in the dope game.   We all realized that the days of fist fighting were over, and most, if not all, conflicts would be resolved through gun violence.  But the way I saw it, if my brother could think nothing of shooting and killing his own flesh and blood, what did that really say about the value of life.  The trust and surety that comes with being siblings had been forever altered.  From that point forward, we were all aware that when we argued with each other, it could easily turn bloody, if not deadly. The fallout from the shooting was major.  Our family was up in arms both figuratively and literally.  They wanted blood – Art’s blood.  Over the course of a few days, as my brother Alan sat in the hospital wondering if he would ever be able to use his right arm again, my other brother slunk through the neighborhood wondering if he would ever be able to come around the family and feel safe again.  I was emotionally confused.  On one hand, I was upset and deeply disturbed by my brother’s actions.  In fact, it was at that point that I started to fear my brother and what he was capable of.  On the other hand, I felt sorry for him because no one in the family wanted anything to do with him.  Whenever he called and tried to explain away his actions, he was either hung up on or threatened.  Eventually, he mustered up the courage to come over to my sister’s neighborhood.  He parked a few blocks over and called up to the apartment.  He spoke briefly with Tamica, but she wasn’t ready for him yet, so she gave me the phone.  After talking to him for a few seconds, I agreed to meet him on the next street.   As I left my sister’s apartment building, I started second-guessing myself.  A deep trepidation started to come over me with each step that I took.  It seemed like a million sinister questions bounced around in my head as I walked to meet Art.  What if he kidnapped me?  What if he shot me like he shot Alan?  What if he came and killed the whole family in a fit of rage?  When I reached the block and saw my brother’s blue Camaro, the questions began to subside.  When I looked inside the car, I saw a vulnerability in my brother that I hadn’t seen in years.  The streets were turning us all into cold-hearted predators, but beneath it all, I could see the brother I had grown up looking up to.  I got into the car and we drove off in silence.   After driving a few short blocks, my brother asked me what the family was saying.  I shared with him what was being said, but told him not to worry.  I tried to reassure him that in time they would forgive him and things would return to normal.  I was trying to convince him as much as I was trying to convince myself that everything would be alright.  We returned to the silence, convinced even more that things would never be the same in our family.   Before Alan got out of the hospital, he took a phone call from Art.  Art apologized for shooting him and Alan forgave him.  A few days later, Alan was released from the hospital.  He wore a sling on his arm and could barely move the right side of his body.  He had a bullet lodged in his shoulder near the back of his neck.  The doctors said that it would work its way out and he would regain the full use of his arm.   Around this time, Art had made a nice connection with one of the major suppliers on the east side.  This connection propelled my brothers to the forefront of the game.  Together, they opened several spots on the east side not far from where we grew up.  When they opened a spot on Glenfield and Chalmers, Alan stopped staying at my sister’s apartment.  He told me to stay behind for a while and he would come get me later when he was established.  In the meantime, he gave me a sack to sell so that I would have a few dollars in my pocket.  It had been a couple of months or so since the last time I smoked a laced joint and I felt like I was ready to get back to the business of hustling.   My sister’s apartment building was the perfect set-up for me.  The building had a built-in clientele with addicts occupying nearly every apartment on all three floors.  Once I let them know that I had a sack, all I did was sit outside in front of the building serving them as they hustled up on whatever they could afford to cop.  Within weeks, the money was rolling in and I felt my swagger coming back.  I couldn’t wait to go shopping and get fresh again.   I went shopping down in Highland Park and came back with some fly Bally’s, a few silk shirts and a couple Guess outfits.  I started hanging around the corner on a street named Savannah where all the neighborhood girls hung at.  They adored me and I felt like a ‘hood celebrity.  I was always generous with my illicit capital, which went over well with the young girls and influential guys.   My sister’s neighborhood was right down the street from Palmer Park, which was transvestite central.  Because of the high level of prostitution that took place at the park, it was prime drug real estate.  The transvestites who lived in the ‘hood spent hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of dollars a day.  Sometimes a few of the guys from Savannah would come hang out at Ted’s, a neighborhood restaurant where we sold rocks and talked shit all day.  We would laugh as we watched streams of balding White men roam up and down Woodward picking up transvestites and crack whores to trick with.  Most of them drove luxury sedans and lived in the surrounding suburbs.  This was one of the many contradictions in the ‘hood.  Affluent white men were free to come into our community and buy drugs and sex with impunity.  Whenever they were pulled over for soliciting, they were given a slap on the wrist and returned to the safety of the suburbs.  On the flip side, the parks we once played in as children were no longer safe – drug paraphernalia and used condoms littered the ground – and the streets that were at one time a source of pride were now the scourges of the city. I continued selling for a few weeks and things started looking promising for me.  My brothers were coming up, and sometimes they would come get me to go shopping with them.  At other times, they brought me sacks to flip for them.  One day, while I was sitting in front of my sister’s apartment building, I noticed a fly young lady going into a fourplex located next door.  I knew the man and woman who lived there because they were cool with Tamica and her children’s father.  I asked Tamica what she knew about the young lady and she called next door to ask her friend Cookie what was up. Cookie told her that the young lady was her niece and Tamica suggested that I go over there and talk to her.   My sister was always trying to hook me up.  We were the closest out of my siblings, and at that time, there was a lot going on in our lives that brought us even closer.  She had recently had her second son, and I was there during his birth.  In addition, I was there when her boyfriend first started abusing her.  Like most teenage girls who fall in love with older men, she was in over her head.  Her boyfriend started out slapping her over minor disagreements, but before long, his abuse escalated to the point where I had to go get her from the house on several occasions.  I was a scrawny teen and knew that I was no match for her boyfriend, who stood 6’2” and had a muscular build, so whenever she called me and told me to come get her, I grabbed the biggest butcher knife I could find and walked to their house.  There were times when he smacked her around or jumped on her and I tried to help, but he would either kick me to the ground or throw me off of his back.  I vowed that I would beat his ass when I got older, but by the time that happened, he was no longer fighting her because he realized that me and my brothers would kill him.  Sadly, it took several years of abuse before my sister finally left that destructive relationship.  She was the perfect example of what happens when a young girl with low self-esteem gets caught up with older men.  After talking with my sister about her friend’s niece, I got fresh and went next door to meet the object of my desire.  When I knocked on the door, Cookie opened the door with a smile on her face.  She told me to come in and meet her niece.  She introduced us, then went into the back room with her husband Lonnie.  Her niece and I hit it off and talked for the next couple of hours.  She said that she would start coming over more often and we exchanged numbers.  After a while, Lonnie emerged from the back room.  His eyes were bloodshot red and it looked like he was enjoying a nice buzz.  We kicked it and he asked me if I wanted a beer.  I said yeah, so we headed up to the store to get a couple of forties.  When we returned, Cookie’s niece was gone, but I stayed over and sat in the back room with Lonnie drinking beer.  As we sat and drunk our beers, I noticed the telltale signs that someone had been smoking laced joints.  I could see where rocks had been crushed on a small mirror and joint cocktails had been emptied out to make another joint.  Plus, the smell of cocaine was undeniable.  After awhile, Lonnie asked me if I smoked weed and I told him that I did on occasion.  He then pulled out a small sack of weed and poured it on the mirror alongside a few crumbs of crack.  He asked me if I knew where he could get some rocks from.  I told him I did and proceeded to pull the sack out of my drawers.  He bought a rock, crunched it up, and then laced the weed with it.  He then handed me the plate and told me that I could roll my own joint if I didn’t want to hit the laced joint.  I thought about it for a minute.  I didn’t want to appear soft or timid in front of him, so I told him I was cool with hitting the joint he had just rolled.  I had stopped on my own before, and I was confident that I would be able to hit it just that one time and be good.  In the back of my mind, I knew I was lying to myself.  Crack has a magnetic pull that is nearly inescapable once you start smoking.  The high seduces you and makes you think you are in control, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Despite me knowing this, I inhaled the thick, white smoke deep into my teenage lungs.  The rush from the high was instantaneous, and before I knew it, I was crushing up more rocks for us to smoke in laced joints and cigarettes.   When I left that night, I knew that I would return time and time again when I had a new sack.  Over the next few weeks, I hung out at Lonnie’s smoking laced joints with rocks I had cut down from the sacks that my brothers had given me.  I kept their money straight, but I was no longer buying the clothes and shoes that my brothers were accustomed to me buying.  They were oblivious to what was going on because I made up all kinds of excuses about why I didn’t have any money or new clothes.  They had no idea that they were supplying their baby brother with a toxic drug that was killing my youth.  My brother Alan became more stable and invited me to move in with him on Glenfield.  We moved into a small, two-bedroom house on the corner of Glenfield and Queen, which was down the street from his spot.  I was still smoking laced joints when I first moved over there, and my supply was now a lot steadier because I was living in the house with my supplier.  I would steal rocks as I helped my brothers cut up and count sacks of rocks. They were making so much money that they never noticed what I was taking off of the top of each sack.   Whenever my brothers needed someone to work their spots, they called on me and I sold the rocks for them.  I sat in spots on Bewick between Warren and Shoemaker, on Pennsylvania and on Lenox and Jefferson.  I thought nothing of the fact that my brothers didn’t care enough about me to keep me away from danger.  Instead, they were blinded by the greed and power that comes with the dope game.  I sat in spots, had sex with grown women, and smoked laced joints for about six months.  Then, one day I woke up and realized that I was tired of being broke, so I decided to stop smoking laced joints cold turkey.  It was very hard at first because I had free access to the sacks.  Around this time, things also began to intensify in the dope game.  It seemed like everybody was out for themselves and my brother Art got into a major beef with his supplier.  It had gotten to the point where we were all on edge, and one day, things reached a boiling point at the spot on Bewick.  My brother had commandeered the spot and was intent on putting his own dope down.  I was at the house when his supplier and a team of his goons came over.  The supplier also brought his woman, who happened to live next door to my mother, with them.  In addition to the tension over the spot, there was a rumor that my brother and his right-hand man had hit the supplier’s woman’s house for a key of yayo.   When the supplier came in with his team of goons, I was a bit nervous.  They were all strapped with pistols and kept whispering to each other as they waited for my brothers and our childhood friend Jesse Peeples to come over. When my brother Art arrived, he entered the house with the confidence of a lion despite his small stature.  He was barely 5’6” and didn’t weigh a pound over one-fifty, but what he lacked in size, he made up for in moxy and tenacity.  When Jesse came into the house, he quickly assessed the situation and stashed a pistol inside of a bag of candy that was on the couch where he was sitting.  The room was tense and attitudes were stretched to their breaking point.  My brother Art told me to leave and go tell my mother what was up in case anything happened; however, I couldn’t get out of the house because the supplier had taken the key to the Armor Guard door.  For what seemed like an eternity, they argued back and forth and no one allowed their hand to move far from their pistol.  All it would have taken was one person to panic and the entire house would have erupted into a hail of gunfire.  As I sat on the couch watching the whole scene play out, I began questioning why I was there in the first place.  The dope game hadn’t been kind to me, and I could feel the effects of the violence and drug abuse stripping away the good that my parents had instilled in me as a child.  Yet when the air was clear, it was back to business as usual.  My brothers continued to hustle and I continued to hustle alongside them, but with each day, the cost of doing business in the streets got higher and higher. One day, my brother Art came over and asked me to sit in a spot over on Lenox.  When we went to check it out, I felt good about it.  They had a nice system in place, and there was a nice thick sista named Michel who would be sitting in the spot with me.  She was down to hustle and wasn’t bad on the eyes, so it was a win-win, or so I thought.  Things went smoothly the first night.  The people downstairs answered the door, took the money from the customers, and then brought it up so that we could make the sale.  We never interacted with the customers, and if the spot were to be raided, the police would be searching downstairs while we got rid of everything upstairs.   One night around two o’clock in the morning, a customer came to the door.  The man downstairs came up and bought a couple of rocks from us.  Two minutes after he took the rock downstairs, I heard the sound of a shotgun blast coming from the back of the house.  I jumped up and ran into the living room to see what was up, and before I knew it, I heard another blast tear through the door downstairs.  Michel and the man who lived in the house scrambled from the back room to see what was going on.  Another shotgun blast went off followed by the sound of someone trying to kick in the back door. It didn’t take long for us to figure out that someone was attempting to rob us.   My heart began beating rapidly as I thought about what would happen if they made it into the house.  My brother hadn’t dropped the rifle off he had promised and we didn’t have any way of defending ourselves.  Michel and I ran to the front of the house and hid in the closet.  The sound of them trying to kick in the door reverberated through the house, filling the air with the menacing sound of imminent death.  If they made it inside, I was sure that they were going to kill us all so I decided to take action.  I told Michel that I was going to make a run for it and she had better follow if she wanted to survive.  She agreed and we crept down the front stairs toward the door.  We listened intently for a minute to see if they were coming around to the front.  When we didn’t hear anything, we cracked the door open.  I told Michel to be ready to go on the count of three.  When I reached three, we both took off running out of the house at full speed.  I could hear Michel on my heels but I wasn’t about to waste time looking back.  When we reached Jefferson, we stopped running and looked to see if anyone was following us.  It was late and I knew that the police might roll up on us, so I stashed the dope I had beneath some bushes on the side of a building.  Everything was closed except for a Wendy’s drive-thru.  I ran the short distance to Wendy’s and approached the window.  I asked them if I could use their phone to call a cab.  The girl working the window looked alarmed and closed the window on me.  I was a bit out of breath and apparently looked out of place standing at her window at that time of night.  The manager came, and after several minutes of going back and forth, he called us a cab.   It seemed like the cab was taking forever.  I knew our assailants would figure out that we had fled, and at any minute, would come looking for us.  I couldn’t have been more relieved when I saw a green and white Checker Cab pull in front of the restaurant.  We hopped in and sped off.  We dropped Michel off and I headed over to the house on Bewick.  I immediately called my brother and he came to pick me up.  We went back to the bushes where I had hid the dope.  I picked up the sack and we drove over to the house on Lenox to see how much damage had been done.  It was dark as hell in the house and we couldn’t really see too well so we left and came back the next day with a rifle and it was back to the grind.  After rolling on Lenox for a few weeks, I was tired of the drama and went back to the house on Glenfield.  I spent most of my time hanging out on the block with the guys from the neighborhood.  Even though Glenfield wasn’t far from where I grew up, it was a foreign part of the ‘hood to me so I had to make a whole new group of friends.  It didn’t take long, however, because Glenfield was one of the livest blocks in that part of the ‘hood.  It also didn’t hurt that my brothers kept me fresh and gave me free reign to do whatever I wanted to do.  I always had money in my pocket and my brother Alan didn’t mind my friends coming over to hang out at the house.   I mostly hung out with the older guys, which meant I was around a lot of older females, many of whom were feeling me.  My interactions with these older females accelerated my development when it came to sexual intimacy, and before long, I thought I was grown.  I had a few girlfriends who were my age, but most of the women I slept with were grown.  My first main girl was a chocolate brown sweetie named Teresa.  She was my age, but had already had a baby.  I met her through one of the guys that had gone to elementary school with me.  She was a friend of his cousin who lived down the street from me.  When we first started going out, she wanted to take things slowly because she didn’t want to get pregnant again.  Things started off slow, but before long, we were together every day.  Like most teenagers, we argued, broke up and got back together again.  In between our break-ups, I started messing with another girl named Chris who lived across the street from me.  She knew that I was with Teresa, but didn’t seem to care. It wasn’t long before I moved on to the next girl in the neighborhood.  This went on for a while until I met an older female named Kay-Kay.  She hung out at her cousin Lynn’s house, which is where all the real action was.  Before long, my whole crew was hanging out at Lynn’s every day with all of the females on the block.  Most of them were in their early twenties, and most of us were in our mid-to-late teens, with me being the youngest.  Not once did I stop to consider there was something wrong with adult women sleeping with teenage boys.  All I knew was that they had what I wanted and didn’t have a problem giving it to me.   This distorted introduction to relationships led me to develop a negative view of dating and romance.  Most of the women and girls I had been intimate with seemed to only care about who was getting money and who could provide weed and drinks, so even though I was being pleased physically on a regular basis, I went to bed feeling empty and alone every night.  The ideas that I had about romance and courtship were shattered by the experiences I had selling drugs and sleeping with adult women before I had developed emotionally.  Sadly, there is a double standard in our community when it comes to these unhealthy relationships.  When a young boy enters a sexual relationship with a grown woman, he is patted on the back and celebrated.  However, when a young girl enters into a relationship with a grown man, he is seen as a lecherous pervert and condemned; and in some cases sent to prison.  The reality is that no adult, under no circumstances, should have a sexual relationship with a child.  It took years for me to first recognize that my emotional growth had been stunted due to these unhealthy relationships, and secondly, for me to overcome all that I had experienced in order for me to have the kind of relationship that I desired and deserved.   Things began settling down when my brother’s girlfriend moved up from Chicago along with her three children.  Our house started feeling more like a home and things were looking promising.  It wasn’t long, however, before the brutality of the streets reared its ugly head again.  One day, we were all standing outside kicking it when a female named Pig came running down the street screaming and crying.  She told us that her cousin Shannon Bell had gotten shot and killed.  “Damn, I was just talking to him the other day,” was the first thought that came to my mind.  I hadn’t seen Shannon since our days in elementary school, but we ran into each other on Glenfield and hung out whenever he came to visit Pig and her sister.  Then, in a flash, he was gone.  Shot dead at the tender age of fifteen.  There was no immediate shock when we heard the news as Detroit was experiencing another long, bloody year, but later on while reminiscing with the rest of the crew, we all had that lingering question in the back of our minds, “Who’s gonna be next?” and “How soon?”   Though we never said it out loud, our body language spoke for us.  The tenseness of our movements, the alertness of our eyes as strangers approached us, and the impulsive way we reacted to any potential threat, spoke volumes.  It was very clear that the stakes had been raised.  The innocence of our youth was slowly disappearing and life in the ‘hood had been cheapened.  Over the years, the body count would continue to accumulate, and “here one day, gone the next” became a neighborhood slogan. Not long after Shannon was killed, a guy named Pops, who lived across the street from us, was shot nineteen times.  Fortunately for him, he survived, but the scars were deeply embedded in all of us.  We all hung our heads in silence when we went to visit him in the hospital.  He had holes all over his body.  All we could think about was revenge, but revenge against who was the question.  His assailants were faceless, nameless men.  They were men who could be anyone, at anytime, and that reality drew us into a sinister silence.  The ‘hood was at war with itself, turning on itself like a possessed cannibal, carnivorously destroying life and leaving in its wake torn families, abandoned children and a vicious cycle of gun violence; however, the real tragedy of seeing my homies die and get shot at such an early age was that I became desensitized to life.  I no longer believed in the good or joy that life had to offer, and I started growing colder inside; to be anything else was to be considered weak.   Sadly, I no longer cared if I lived or died.  In fact, I started looking forward to the day of my demise.  It gave me a sense of control.  If I embraced death, then I wouldn’t have to live in fear of dying, at least that’s what I told myself.  The reality was that I was truly afraid of living because living was too painful. My dreams of growing old with my family were an illusion that shriveled up like a prune sitting in the sun.  In essense, I had given in to the monster under the bed.  I grew reckless and moved through life uncaring and numb from fear, paranoia and the copious amounts of malt liquor that I consumed.  Around each corner, I thought there was a bullet with my name on it and saw fast-approaching vehicles as death machines chauffeured by the grim reaper himself.   With everything I had experienced, I knew it was only a matter of time before I became a dead man walking or a death machine; it was all in fate’s hands.  If I were quick on the draw, I would be the latter, but if not, then I would be joining the hundreds of young men and women who were lost in the war that rages through our community. How can a child expect to exist like this without going insane?  It would only be a matter of time before I found the answer. Things on Glenfield began deteriorating as fall approached.  One night, I was sitting in the living room when I heard a loud commotion on our front porch.  When I looked out of the window, I noticed a man with a gun pointed at my brother Alan’s head while his girlfriend stood nearby with her hands in the air.  I immediately leapt into action.  I didn’t stop to think about anything other than saving my brother.  I grabbed a pistol out of the closet, ran out of the back door, and then circled around the house.  I hollered for the gunman to back away from my brother.  He pushed Alan and took off running as I squeezed off several shots.  My brother and his girl were unharmed and the gunman got away.  Not long after that, my brother decided to relocate to the west side to a neighborhood called Brightmoor.  I wasn’t ready to leave the east side yet, so I stayed behind for a while longer.   Before he moved, my brother told one of his old friends that she and her daughters could share the house with me and she became somewhat of a guardian.  I was basically doing the same thing, however, so it was business as usual.  During this time, one of my homeboys from the other end of the ‘hood came to hang out with me.  His name was Boise and I hadn’t seen him in awhile.  We had gone to Burbank Middle School together.  Boise was known for playing drums in school and being one of the best dancers in the neighborhood.  We used to skip class and breakdance in the school bathroom along with two other guys named Terrance and Tanzer who lived down the street from Boise.  We had forged a little bond in school, so when we ran back into each other, it was all good.  We were now a few years older and our interests were the same – drinking, smoking and messing with women.  We told everyone that we were cousins, and I introduced him to this woman named KC.  For the next few weeks, we hung out at Lynn’s house partying it up.  Little did I know, Boise was on the run for two counts of murder.  It wasn’t until I moved to the west side and we lost contact that I found out what happened.  Our next meeting would be in prison at the Michigan Reformatory.   Finally, after countless days of drinking and sexing, my brother Art told me that I needed to move off of Glenfield.  Every time he came over, the house was full of weed smoke and teenagers who thought they were grown.  My teenage body and mind were a bit worn down so I welcomed a change of pace.  I thought I was ready to get my life back on track, so I called my father and let him know that I wanted to come home.  He had a conversation with my stepmother and they agreed to allow me to move into their home on the west side.   The neighborhood right off of Southfield and Puritan was a far cry from Glenfield.  The streets were lined with big brick houses and manicured lawns.  There was very little traffic so it was nice and quiet, and I hated every bit of it.  It was close to being winter, and I didn’t know anyone in the ‘hood, so I was miserable.  Every chance I got, I returned to the east side, but once I enrolled in school, my view of the neighborhood changed.  In addition to the ‘hood being full of women, it was a haven for money-getters and ‘hood celebrities.  Within a few weeks, I felt like that was where I belonged, or so I thought. Chapter 10 The clanging of steel cage doors slamming shut was the sounding bell for the young gladiators housed at the Michigan Reformatory.  On any given day, when the doors banged open for yard or chow, we would count on some drama, and my first day at MR was no exception to the rule.  In fact, what I witnessed on the first day was the rule of the ‘Big Yard.’  It made what I experienced at Riverside seem like mere child’s play by comparison. When we arrived at the prison, I noticed the stark difference between MR and Riverside.  The college-like campus, manicured lawn, and well-maintained infrastructure were replaced by an antiquated behemoth of a prison.  The large, grey walls surrounded the prison with a finality that stamped out any thoughts of freedom.  The block-long tiers seethed with the looming threat of violence and mayhem, and the guards stood ready to break the heads of anyone who dared to go against the grain.   Just on appearance alone, the Michigan Reformatory had earned its moniker Gladiator School.  One look at the dusty yard littered with black and brown bodies was enough to transport one back to the coliseum in Rome where blood sports were daily entertainment.  We were hustled out of the van and into the old, cavernous building.  We all remained silent out of fear that our voices would betray the poisonous thoughts swimming around in our minds like sea snakes.  When I looked at the motley crew of inmates who had transferred in with me, I could see the same fear in them that was gurgling in the pit of my stomach. It wasn’t a fear of being harmed or violated; it was the fear of the unknown.  To break the tension, we joked around with each other before we all turned our attention toward the one White guy who had made the trip with us.  He was one of the few White guys who had enough swagger to hang around our little circle.  He wasn’t trying to be anyone but himself, and that was a quality that we appreciated.   All too often in prison, I ran across White guys from the suburbs or one of Michigan’s rural towns who tried to emulate the swagger of hip hop artists or guys from the streets in their desire to be accepted.  Sadly, this placed them in a position where they were either victimized or put to the test to see if they were really gangster.  The funny thing about it, the ones who didn’t try to be anything other than who they were were accepted, which was the case with Kevin.  He was down-to-earth, minded his own business, had a crazy sense of humor, and was just plain cool.  He could take a good joke and give out a good joke, so as we waited to be processed in, we joked with him about sticking with us so that the booty bandits wouldn’t get him.  He told us to fuck off and joked that we should be sticking with him because he could whoop all of our asses.  We laughed and joked some more as we headed down to the infirmary to get our initial check-up before being sent to the intake rock.  After undergoing another basic physical exam, we were directed to go to I-2, which was the intake rock.  There were two main blocks at the Reformatory, with five floors each.  On each floor, there were two sides – the inside and the outside.  We were led down a murky green hallway until we reached a door leading to I-Block. When we exited the door, we went up a flight of stairs and were met by a Black female officer named Ms. Ingram who gave us our assigned cell numbers.  I was assigned to I-80, which was close to the middle of the rock.  When I looked down the tier, it felt like it would never end.   Once Ms. Ingram had given us our cell numbers, she began clanging the doors open.  We walked down the tier searching out our cell numbers, and once we were inside, the doors slammed shut.  On the way down, I noticed a few guys sticking mirrors out into the hallway.  They called the mirrors ‘hawks,’ because like birds of prey, they were used to zero in on any potential prey.  When I stepped into the cell, my head started spinning and I became nauseous at the sight and smell of my new residence.  It smelled like raw sewage had been dumped on the floor.  The hard, green, plastic-covered mattress was peeling and cracked and the pillow was as flat as a flapjack.  The sink dripped with rusty brown water and the toilet was full of shitty water, which was the source of the horrible smell.  I held my nose closed and prayed the toilet didn’t overflow when I flushed it.  The toilet was stained with the remnants of week-old feces and flushing it did nothing to rid the room of its stench.   Within a few days, we all realized that the one-hundred-year-old reformatory had one of the worst plumbing systems in the state.  Whenever someone a few cells over flushed their toilet, the waste showed up in another toilet.  Nearly every morning, I was awakened by the smell of someone else’s bowel movement floating in my toilet like an unwelcomed guest.  I scrubbed the cell from floor to ceiling and washed down my mattress and pillow.  When I was finished, I made up my bed and laid down.  I listened to the various conversations going on around me.  Most of them were war stories full of ‘hood exploits, or grumblings about the state of the prison.  I drifted off into a dream about my old neighborhood, and just as it started getting good, I was awakened by the sound of our doors being opened for yard.   We filed out of our cells and walked slowly to the big yard.   The group of us that had come over from quarantine together hit the yard.  We had been given ten dollars by the state to purchase store items and couldn’t wait to get some cigarettes and a few food items to supplement the meager scraps we were served at chow.   The sun was out but the fall air was a bit crisp.  When we exited the building, the sounds and the sights were overwhelming.  It looked like there were over a thousand men moving back and forth through the prison.  I had never been in a place with that many people.  We followed the flow of the crowd until we reached the yard.  When we entered, there were between fifty and a hundred guys standing around the store line staring at us.  We stood out from the rest because of the small blue jackets we had been given in quarantine.  We had just arrived so all we had were our state-sponsored clothes.  It was a clear sign that we were new.  Most inmates who were able bought regular clothes from one of the MDOC-approved catalogues, or had them sent from home as soon as possible.  We did all in our power to reclaim whatever sense of normalcy we could.  Sometimes just getting dressed in regular clothing was enough to make us feel free, if only for a moment.  I was also a small way of expressing uniqueness and independence in an environment where you’re seen as just a number.   The veteran inmates were in full predator mode, searching our faces to find who amongst us was weak enough to be considered prey.  It was as though they were able to smell weakness a mile away.  Immediately, we saw a couple of guys walking off with Kevin in tow.  They had their arms draped around his shoulders.  All we could do was watch helplessly.  We were on enemy terrain. and at the end of the day, it was every man for himself.  No matter how cool we all were, we all knew we had to stand up for ourselves before we could expect someone else to ride for us.  Once we got our store items, we headed over to the basketball court to observe the games.  It was easy to see that the basketball court was one of the proving grounds on the yard.  Once you stepped onto the basketball court, you had better be ready to defend yourself on every level.  No blood, no foul was the rule of the blacktop.  It was common for inmates to play basketball with a shank in the sole of their shoes.  A hard foul could easily lead to a stabbing, or worse, a riot.   The games we checked out were tense and very competitive.  There were a few guys who stood out immediately on the court.  There was a tall, slinky guy who I would later learn was named Bone.  He played above the rim and dunked damn near everything that came off of the rim.  He was one of the many basketball legends that I would meet over the years.   When yard closed, we headed back to the rock and waited for chow time.  Our movement was restricted because we were in close custody, which meant we were only allowed out for yard for an hour a day.  I didn’t have any books so I spent the first few days looking out of the window when the other rocks were out on the yard.  When I wasn’t looking out of the window, I slept.  In fact, I think I slept more during the first year of my bit than I have at any other point in my life.  It was a clear sign that I was suffering from the depression that came with losing my freedom.  Sleep allowed me to dream, and dreaming was my way of connecting with life on the street.   After a few minutes listening to my neighbors talk about what they had witnessed on the yard, I dozed off.  Before I could get into a deep sleep, I was awakened by the sound of keys jingling loudly as several officers ran down the rock.  I strained to see as far down the rock as I could before they were out of my sight.  The rest of the guys on the rock grew quiet as we listened to find out what was going on.  After nearly an hour, the officers and nurses rolled a gurney down the tier with a body on it.  They had a white sheet draped across the inmate’s face, and we later learned that it was Kevin they had wheeled out of the building.  By the time we came out for chow, the word spread through the prison that Kevin attempted suicide after being pressured for sex.  It was a sobering reminder to all of us that we were living in a jungle of desperation and hopelessness.  The next morning on the way to breakfast, I witnessed my first stabbing.  We took the back steps down, and as we were walking, a slim, dark-skinned brother slid past us and stabbed a guy in front of us several times in the neck, then calmly discarded the shank in the mailbox at the bottom of the steps.  We jumped back when the guy started stabbing the other man, then walked around the scene.  The guy clutched his neck and took off running back up the stairs.  By the time we reached the walkway headed toward the chow hall, a group of officers were running into the building.  On our way out of chow, they stopped us and shook us all down.  No one said anything and we were allowed to go back to the block.   I stayed up late that night thinking about all of the violence around me.  I looked around the cell to see what I could make a shank out of.  Making shanks became a skill that I perfected over the years; the more time I did, the more capable I became at manufacturing a weapon on the fly.  A plastic bottle that would normally be discarded became a tool to be melted down and sharpened to a point that was sharp enough to puncture a lung or take an eye out.  The carts we used to cool off fresh baked bread became a smorgasbord of high quality steel shanks, which we called “horses” or “bone crushers.”  Working in the bakery and using a whisk also gave me instant access to a hundred icepicks.  Whatever crude piece of metal I could lay my hands on became a tool of violence.  After nearly two weeks at the Reformatory, I was moved to J-Block.  My first day over there, I witnessed another brutal act of violence.  On the way to chow, a thick-necked, light-skinned brother hit another brother in the head with a lock attached to a belt.  The bulky Master lock knocked a chunk of meat from the victim’s head.  Instead of panicking, he turned around and began punching the guy in the face.  His attacker continued to swing the lock wildly, hitting him in the head several more times until he began losing consciousness.  Their scuffle caused traffic on the steps to back up, which alerted the officers to the scene.   The Gladiator School was proving to be everything we were told it was.  Over the next couple of months, I witnessed one act of violence after another.  The whole time, I knew it wouldn’t be long before I was sucked into the drama of the big yard.   Within a few weeks, most of the guys who had transferred in with me were sent to other prisons.  We weren’t seasoned convicts yet and the administration saw fit to send us to the newer correctional facilities.  Several of my associates went to Brooks, which was located in Muskegon, and a few of us were sent to a prison in Carson City.  I was excited because I knew that my brother had been there before.  I was unsure whether he was still there, but I figured there would be someone there who knew him, so when I arrived at the facility, my spirit lifted a little at the thought of seeing my brother Art.   The prison sat on a sprawling piece of land that contained two prisons and a farm on the other side of the gate.  The lawns had been manicured by inmate landscapers and the buildings were modern.  There were microwaves, a pool table, and a universal weight machine in each unit.  The food was quality and we got at least four hours of yard time a day in addition to access to the gym.  The inmates appeared to be less hostile and more optimistic compared to the Reformatory.  I didn’t realize it then, but the facility had been designed to decrease violence and increase the control that the officers had over inmates.   In many ways, the prison gave us a false sense of hope that things would get better.  By creating a more livable environment, the state was creating more docile inmates.  This worked well for those who were easily made complacent by the token treatment we received, but I hadn’t been locked up long enough to be pacified; I was still in the rebellious mode.  Whenever I got into something, the officers would ask the older inmates to talk to me.  The older inmates would come see me and ask me to be cool so that I wouldn’t get myself in trouble, or even worse, get them in trouble.  They told me that one inmate could mess it up for the rest of them.  I wasn’t sympathetic to their pleas and felt insulted that they thought they could tell me what to do.  When I became conscious, I found the perfect name for the inmates who felt compelled to do the officers’ bidding – House Niggas.  Just like the passive slaves who identified with Massa, these boot-licking Negroes worked harder for the administration than they did for themselves.  They were content to have a microwave and more yard.  While it was a convenience, I knew damn well that it wasn’t home and I wasn’t trying to get comfortable.   I started off in 5-Block, which had single man cells.  It was a unit for predators and inmates with behavioral problems; however, they would put anyone in 5 if they didn’t have the bed space.  For the first two weeks, I kept to myself for the most part.  The only person that I talked to on a regular basis was a brother named O’Neal-El.  One day we were talking, and he told me that he needed to finish a book he was writing.  I asked him what he was writing about and he told me he was writing about his neighborhood.  He was a member of the infamous drug crew Young Boys Incorporated and wrote stories loosely based on his experience in the streets.  He wrote his stories in neat block letters on folded prison stationary.  He asked if I wanted to read one of his stories and I started laughing at the idea of an inmate writing a book.  He told me that he was serious, and since I wasn’t doing anything, I said I would read it.   I didn’t really know what to expect, but when I started reading O’Neal-El’s stories, I couldn’t put them down.  They were only about 80 or 90 pages, but they were detailed.  When I finished, I felt like I had grown up alongside them wearing Top Tens, Max Julian coats and campaign hats.  After I read a few of his books, he asked me if I had ever heard of Donald Goines.  I told him I hadn’t and he suggested I go to the library and check him out.  He told me I would love Donald’s work if I liked what he had written.  I sent a kite over to the library and requested to be placed on a callout.  The next week I was given a callout to go to the library.  I asked the clerk if she had any Donald Goines’ books.  She pointed me to a separate room, which contained a lot of books by Black authors.  Upon entering the room, I checked the shelf for Donald Goines and found one of his books entitled, Eldorado Red.  It was the last of his books left on the shelf, so I checked it out.  The clerk gave me a form to fill out that said I would be charged five dollars if I lost the book or it got stolen.  The only books we were required to fill out these forms for were books by Black authors.  I was offended by what I felt was overt racism.  The idea that I couldn’t just go into the library and check out a book by a Black author without being under a cloud of suspicion was offensive to me.  I understood that these books were very popular among the Black prison population, but they were no more popular to us than Jackie Collins and Sidney Sheldon were to White readers yet they didn’t have to fill out a form ensuring that they returned their books.  I mumbled to myself about how racist this practice was as I looked around the room for other books that may have been of interest to me.   The room was full of books with unfamiliar faces and names.  I had never heard of Marcus Garvey, Ivan Van Sertima or Cheik Anta Diop.  However, in that moment, I knew there had to be something to them because they were in the same room as Donald Goines.  I picked up a couple of books and perused the back covers to see if they were of any interest.  I may as well have been reading Sanskrit because I was unfamiliar with words like revolution, colonialism, or repatriate.  I quickly slid the books back on the shelf and returned to the main area of the library.  I gathered up a few more novels and went to the desk to check them out.  I was told that they would hold a few Donald Goines’ novels for me to check out later.  Once I got my books stamped, I left and returned to the unit.  It was nearing time for count so when I got to my cell, I opened up the dog-eared pages of Eldorado Red and became instantly hooked by Donald’s vivid tale of inner city life and the underground lottery.  His storyline had me on the edge of my seat and I yearned for more with each page I turned.  I tried to savor the last few chapters of the book, but I just couldn’t put it down.  Before the end of the night, I was done and thirsting for more.  I read the other novels I had selected, but none were memorable and none left me with the feeling I got when I read Donald’s work.   It felt like my next callout was taking forever, but when that day came, I nearly ran to the library.   I didn’t want anyone to beat me to the room and get Donald’s books before I could get them.  When I reached the library, it was as though the clerks knew I was coming.  They had witnessed the intoxicating effect that Donald’s work had on inmates and knew I would be back.  They smiled as they handed me the books that had been reserved for me.  I held Dopefiend and Whoreson in my hand as though they were the Holy Grail.  I checked out a few more books and quickly headed back to my cell where I read throughout the day and late into the night.  By the time I laid down at three o’clock in the morning, my eyes were on fire.  I couldn’t wait for sunlight so that I could indulge what was fast becoming my deepest passion.  The following week, I transferred to the unit next door where the cells were double-bunked.  My bunky went by the name Murder, which seemed quite funny to me at the time considering he was about 140 pounds soaking wet.  We hit it off immediately.  He was originally from Chicago, but had family on the east side of Detroit where I had grown up.  After a few weeks of kicking it, we realized that our sisters lived on the same street.  He watched television most of the time while I read.  He wasn’t into sports as much as I was and only seemed to like watching movies and old westerns, none of which appealed to me at the time.  I didn’t have my own television, so I stuck to reading whenever I was in the cell.   In addition to reading, I started taking an Office Occupation class, which was really a fancy name for typing, or at least that’s how it seemed considering that’s all we did.  After a couple of weeks, they opened a Food Tech class and I switched over to that.  Murder and I found different ways to ensure that the other person had some alone time in the cell.  This is something that is negotiated between bunkies to ensure they don’t get on each other’s nerves.  Sometimes it’s something as simple as stepping out of the cell and allowing your bunky to put on deodorant and lotion after a shower.  We made sure to respect each other when we were asleep and be considerate enough to take a bowel movement when the other one was out of the cell.  Bunking with anyone can be a challenge, especially when you have a toilet in the cell that must be shared. I continued reading Donald’s collection until I had read every one of them.  Once I was done, a few guys turned me on to Iceberg Slim, Chester Himes and other authors like Harrold Robbins, Sydney Sheldon and Robert Ludlum.  Some of their work I could get into, but none of them inspired me the way Donald did.  Outside of reading, listening to rap was my other passion.  Growing up, music was my first love.  I grew up in a household where you could hear music as diverse as Anita Baker, Prince and Luther Vandross to Parliament Funkadelic, Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd.  My parents, aunts and uncles loved music so I inherited my love of music from them as naturally as the bloodline we shared.  When rap entered my small world, I was hooked like a fish on the line.  As a teenager, I rushed to the record store to get the newest release when my funds would allow, and when I couldn’t afford to, I would swap music with my friends and dub their cassettes, building up a nice collection in the process.   When I entered prison, music became my getaway as much as it had been on the streets.  It wasn’t uncommon for me to sit in the dayroom and listen to other inmates freestyling in the ciphers or reciting the lyrics from their favorite rapper.  It was in this arena that I met a tall, gangly brother who went by the name DJ X. He had a deep, raspy voice and would rap non-stop while beating on his chest.  One day, he was in a cipher rapping and began using a bunch of names that I wasn’t familiar with.  I had heard a few of the names while listening to X Clan and Public Enemy, but I didn’t have a working knowledge of who they were.  Listening to Boogie Down Productions and Rakim, one would think I was conscious, but back then, I was more concerned with the beats and the rhyme structure.  When Chuck D said he was a supporter of Chesimard, I assumed he was talking about someone in his crew.  I had no idea he was using the government name for the woman who would become one of my favorite sheroes – Assata Shakur.  When KRS One took the picture for the cover of his acclaimed album, “By All Means Necessary,” I didn’t know he was updating Malcolm X’s famous photo and saying; however, I soon found out that I knew more than I thought I knew.  I identified with the rebelliousness of their music as well as the African aesthetic; however, I was ignorant to our history and culture, and it was time for my awakening.  When DJ X rapped, he spit with such authority that I assumed these people were gangsters.  I mean, you have to admit, there is a menacing gangster quality about the name Malcolm X.   When DJ X was done rapping, I asked him about some of the names he had mentioned.  He stared at me with an incredulous look on his face.  He couldn’t believe that I didn’t know about Nat Turner and the other brave men and women he had mentioned in his song.  I assured him that I was ignorant, and he suggested that I check out the Autobiography of Malcolm X when I went to the library.  So on my next trip, that’s exactly what I did.  When I picked up the Autobiography of Malcolm X, the picture on the cover was familiar. I had noticed a few brothers wearing T-shirts with Malcolm’s image on the front.  I had also seen a few clips on the news regarding Spike Lee’s making of the movie, but I didn’t stop long enough to pay attention to what all the hoopla was about.  All I knew was that White people appeared to be very upset.  The more I thought about it, the more familiar the name started to sound.  Not long before I came to the joint, a school named Malcolm X Academy had opened up in Detroit, and there was White uproar about that as well.   As the pieces of the puzzle started coming together, I knew that Malcolm X had to be a serious gangster.  However, when I read the back cover of the book, I was a bit let down.  I saw that Alex Haley had co-written the book and that immediately started to change my image of Malcolm.  I just knew I was about to read another in a long list of stories about Black people who just wanted to get along.  I had grown tired of the Martin Luther King “I Have a Dream” and Rosa Parks back-of-the-bus stories.  To me, they only served two purposes.  One was to make White people feel guilt-free, and the other was to appease Black people and ensure that we remained docile in our approach to independence.  Though I wasn’t born during the Civil Rights Era, I had witnessed enough police brutality in the ‘hood to know that I would never endorse a non-violent movement.  Despite my initial apprehension and obvious ignorance about the true meaning of human and civil rights, I decided to go ahead and read the book, and without question, it was the best and most important decision I could have made at that point in my bit.   While Donald Goines’ collection of novels was the beginning of my growth as a man, it was Malcolm’s autobiography that ultimately snatched my eyes open.  The rawness of Donald’s writing and his ability to articulate the pain of inner city life created a burning desire in me to read, but Malcolm’s classic tome imbedded in me a burning desire to do something meaningful with my life.  Once I finished reading Malcolm, I began reading with a purpose.  I wanted to know as much as I could about the world we lived in.  I read everything from political science to erotica to contemporary fiction and philosophy; however, it was my reading of Black history as told by people of African descent that allowed me to put things in perspective.  It helped me understand why the majority of the prison population looked like me and why there were so many deep-rooted racial antagonisms inside of prison.  It was evident that the Prison Industrial Complex had replaced the slave plantations.  My reading of Black history gave me a sense of pride and dignity that I didn’t have prior to coming to prison.  In school, the things we learned about Black history were designed to keep us dreaming of a better tomorrow, one that would only come when White America felt sorry enough to treat us as equals.  This never set well with me, and for the most part, left me feeling angry, inferior and confused.  I couldn’t understand why White people hated us so much and why they didn’t want us to have the same opportunities in life that they had. I soon realized that the little bit of Black history that they taught in public schools really served a White elitist agenda.  I didn’t learn about freed0om fighters like Nat Turner, Toussaint L’Overture, Ann Nzingah, Assata Shakur, Malcolm X, and Huey P. Newton until I came to prison.  I didn’t know there were African kingdoms like Mali, Ashanti, and Timbuktu until I read classic works by scholars Chancellor Williams, Cheik Anta Diop, Dr. Ben Jochannan, and J.A. Rogers.  It was then that I discovered our great contributions to the world and realized my self-worth.  I had descended from greatness, therefore nothing was impossible for me.  I learned that my ancestors were more than passive observers of history; they were in fact an integral part of the development of civilization as we know it today. The more I read Malcolm X’s autobiography, the more things started to make sense to me.  Coming into prison, I was confused about religion.  I had long ago given up the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Jesus that my mother worshipped.  I had been raised to believe in Jesus, but my mother never tried to force religion on us, at least not intentionally.  There were never any critical questions raised regarding religion and its origin in our household.  When we went to church or Sunday school, we were expected to accept whatever the preacher and the Bible said was true.   I never had any point of reference outside of Christianity when I came to prison, and like many who find themselves in serious trouble, I always turned to Jesus with the hopes that he would pull me out of the fine mess I had found myself in.  My motivation was clearly to get my ass out of hot water; I wasn’t seeking any real relationship with God.  So when things didn’t turn out the way I had prayed for, I said to hell with God, Jesus, the Bible and anything associated with it.  However, there was a small part of me that desired a sincere spiritual connection to the source of all life, and I was now on a quest to feed that desire.  Malcolm’s autobiography was the first book to make me question Christianity.  His insights into how Christianity had been used to make African people passive in the face of such horrendous treatment by slave masters made me look at things differently.  I started to question why all of the characters in the Bible were depicted as White.  I didn’t, and still don’t, have any personal biases toward White people, but I wanted to know where all the Black people were in the Bible.  I knew we hadn’t just fallen from the sky.  When I asked others who were Christian, I was either met with a blank stare or told it didn’t matter, that God wasn’t a color.  It was the politically correct thing for them to say, however their unease and nervousness suggested that they knew differently.  The fact of the matter is that color does matter, and proof of this is revealed in how churches continue to portray Jesus as White despite the lack of historical data that says he looked anything like how he’s depicted.  In fact, it is well known that the Jesus we know today is a figment of Michael Angelo’s imagination as painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.   The more disenchanted I became with Christianity, the more intrigued I became with Islam. Malcolm’s experience in Mecca and his description of Islam as a religious brotherhood that didn’t discriminate made me feel good.  From the time I was a child, I envisioned a world that was all-inclusive and a God that was all-loving, regardless of color.  So once I read about Islam, I began researching the Islamic organizations in prison.  At the time, there were four dominant Islamic groups in Michigan prisons.  There is the Sunni Muslim sect, which holds traditional Islamic beliefs.  There is the Nation of Islam, which has strong Black nationalist views and its members follow the teachings of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and Minister Farrakhan. There is also the Moorish Science Temple of America, which follows the teachings of Prophet Noble Drew Ali.  This group is one of the first Asiatic Islamic groups in North America and has the largest following in prison.  Finally, there was the Melanic Islamic Palace of the Rising Sun, which was officially disbanded in 2000 and officially designated a gang.  Similar to tactics employed by J. Edgar Hoover and COINTELPRO, the MDOC lodged trumped-up charges against the oganization’s head officials and labeled the organization a Security Threat Group. It was this organization that drew my interest the most due to their militant Afrocentric ideology.  I was impressed by the discipline and cultural perspective of the few members I had encountered, and admired the red, black and green badge that they wore because it reminded me of X Clan and other rappers I identified with.   The Melanic Islamic Palace of the Rising Sun was comprised of Black nationalists who combined the teachings of other organizations that had preceded it like the Black Panther Party and the Organization of African American Unity.  Even though the Bible and Quran were the spiritual books of choice, they weren’t exclusive.  The members were encouraged to read other spiritual texts and drink from the many spiritual streams that our ancestors used to quench their thirst for spiritual rejuvenation.  It wasn’t uncommon for a spiritual advisor to quote David Walker’s Appeal or George Jackson’s Blood in My Eye during a sermon, then open to a passage in the Bible or a surah in the Quran.  Instead of trying to razzle dazzle us with an imaginary paradise in the sky or a terrifying threat of eternal damnation, the spiritual advisors set out to help us understand our daily realities, and this approach resonated with me.  It made me think about Malcolm and his approach to reaching the downtrodden amongst us.  Instead of standing at the podium as though he was on the mountaintop, Malcolm came down and walked amongst the people.  He was the people; he related to their struggle, their pain and their frustration because he had lived it.   This is what I witnessed when I finally relented and decided to attend one of the Melanic’s Saturday morning services.  I had ducked the brothers who asked me to attend various services for several weeks.  It was still early in my bit and I didn’t like getting up early in the morning.  Plus, I didn’t want to get labeled as soft for attending an Islamic service.  In prison, there is a negative stigma attached to some of the guys who attend service.  Muslims have a reputation of sticking together and taking care of their members’ problems, not unlike any other family or social group where the individual’s problem become the group’s problem.  Sadly, however, there are inmates who take advantage of this reality.  Some need protection, some are opportunists who seize the opportunity to have their basic needs met, and others are in search of the acceptance they didn’t get from their own family, so I was very careful about my decision to attend Melanic services.  Eventually, after reading several more books and holding a few conversations, I decided to check out a service.  The services were unlike anything I had ever experienced in a church.  The podium was decorated with a large red, black and green flag and a picture of Nat Turner, who I would later learn was the organization’s prophet.  The brothers wore neatly pressed blues and polished shoes.  Most of them wore black fezzes and stood until they were given instruction to be seated.  The brothers at the door wore stoic expressions as they directed guests to the front of the room where we stood as the members proceeded to do the call to prayer.  I was impressed by the preciseness of their movements as they formed a ten-man prayer pyramid.  When the final row of the pyramid was filled, the brothers moved in a counter-clockwise motion as they called out to our ancestors.  It was an awesome display of power, respect and spirituality.  In an uncompromising display of solidarity, the brothers paid homage to those who came before us while praising the Creator for a chance to do something meaningful for our people.   Once the prayers had been said and the laws of the organization read, a brother was called up to speak.  He talked about the importance of unity and shared the history of Nat Turner.   I was even more intrigued as I listened to the story of Prophet Nat Turner who organized the largest African uprising on the shores of North America.  While attending school, I had never heard of a Black person fighting for their freedom through armed resistance.  Later on, I found the prison administration hypocritical because they portrayed our organization as advocating violence because we embraced Nat Turner as our prophet.  How can a country that celebrates George Washington, who led the fight for independence against Britain’s tyranny, condemn us for honoring a man who fought against one of the vilest systems know to man?  In their eyes, it is heroic for White men and women to fight for liberation but criminal for people of African descent to take a stand against those who oppressed them.  In the coming weeks, I would learn just how much the administration despised those who wanted to change from predators on our community to freedom fighters and agents of change.  After that first service, the brothers asked me if I would come back and visit again.  I told them that I wouldn’t make any promises, but I’d consider it.  Over the next couple of months, I visited service sporadically.  It didn’t have anything to do with their teachings or other people’s perceptions; it was simply a matter of timing.  I am nocturnal by nature and spent most nights reading until two or three o’clock in the morning, so the last thing I wanted to do was get up at seven o’clock in the morning to get ready for service.  Despite this, I kept reading and building with the brothers.   As important as my spiritual and intellectual growth was, there was something more important manifesting in my life.  The months had been moving swiftly and the winter was fast upon us. With each frosty day that came and went, I knew I was one day closer to getting the news I had been waiting to hear for the last eight months.  It was late December and I called home to get an update on Brenda.  It had been a few months since I saw her last and we were only talking occasionally.  The cost of phone calls had long ago taken their toll and Georgia couldn’t afford to take calls on a daily basis.  Brenda did what she could to help with the phone bill, and I did my best not to call too much.  When Georgia answered, she told me that Brenda was due to have the baby any day.  She said Brenda wasn’t available to speak, but told me to call back in a few days.  Instead, I waited about a week and a half before I called Georgia again. On January 7, 1992, I stepped outside of the unit into the frosty winter air.  My hands nearly froze the moment I took them out of my pocket to dial the number.  The cold winter air sliced through the thin fabric of my state coat like a bayonet.  When Georgia answered the phone, I knew that my son had been born into the world.  Her voice cascaded through the phone like the music from a symphony.  I listened intently as my eyes watered with tears that froze as soon as they hit the air.  I had mixed emotions as I thought about what the birth of my son meant for Brenda and I.  I was happy to hear that he had been born healthy and Brenda decided to name him after me, but my chest felt heavy, as though I had swallowed a cinder block.  A deep sadness engulfed my entire being.  It hurt like hell knowing that I wouldn’t be there to guide my son through life.  In addition to letting my daughter down, I had let Brenda and my newborn son down.   In the few weeks preceding my son’s birth, I had been learning a lot about the conditions of young Black males.  I was concerned about my son getting caught up in the same cycle of violence, drugs and crime that had claimed so many from my generation, including me.  I didn’t want my son to become another in a long line of young Black males who became statistics, and I didn’t want my daughter to end up like Brenda and the countless single mothers who fall hard for males like me who wouldn’t be around to raise the children we helped create.  The more I thought about it, the angrier I became.  I didn’t know how to process what I was feeling at the time and it began eating away at me. I felt guilty about being an absentee father, yet I didn’t want to take responsibility for the actions that led me to be taken out of my children’s lives.  I was learning a lot about White supremacy and the role it played in filling America’s prisons with young Black males.  This new knowledge provided the perfect target for the toxic anger that was consuming me.  When I returned to my cell, I lay on my bunk and thought about my son.  I imagined what he looked like.  I wondered what characteristics he had inherited from me and which ones he had inherited from his mother.  Brenda was a pretty young lady, and I thought I was a decent looking brother, so I was sure that our son would be a cute baby.  As I thought about him, my heart began filling with an unbelievable joy and I knew I had to find a way to be a part of my son’s life.  In that moment, I made a vow to find a way to be a father even though I was in prison.  I knew one of the first things I had to do was change my thinking.  I could no longer think destructively about other Black males.  I could no longer justify shooting, beating or selling drugs to those who looked like me.  I had to reclaim my humanity and soften my heart so that I could be the voice of reason and spirit of wisdom that my children could always rely on.  I knew I was in for the fight of my life, but I was prepared for battle.  I knew that “nigga” in me had to be choked and subdued by the African warrior I was destined to become.  There could be no more settling for less in my life.  I had given up on myself and my family, but I would be damned if I gave up on my children.  I knew it wouldn’t be an easy victory, but I was determined to fight against the side of me that had me believing that I couldn’t be anything more than a thuggish criminal and predator on my community.  No matter how many times I was knocked to the ground, I was determined to get up over and over until I was able to stand on the firm, proud, strong legs of an African man and father.  Without compromise or apologies, I had begun my journey of transformation. The first year or so was the hardest because I was deeply entrenched in the anger phase of my transformation.  The more I read about White people’s treatment of people of African descent, the angrier I became.  I felt justified in my rage toward White staff and inmates.  I empathized with my ancestors and felt tears pour from my heart with each story of lynching and rape that I read.  I was growing dangerously intelligent.  What I didn’t realize at the time was how distorted my thinking had become.  Instead of going beneath the surface and delving into the root causes of my negative thinking and violent behavior, I covered up my pain by directing it toward White people.  This allowed me to justify my outbursts and remain unaccountable for my role in how things in my life were turning out.   It wasn’t until nearly eight years later that I had a real awakening and grew into the fullness of my potential.  In the meantime, I waged a daily battle with my old way of thinking, and sadly, the New Afrikan warrior that I had become wasn’t always the victor.  One day, after learning that Brenda hadn’t sent the money off that she promised, the “nigga” in me assumed control of the ship.  True to form, chaos ensued, and I found myself heading down a dark, murky path.  For the first time during my bit, I would learn the true meaning of hell on earth. Chapter 11 The thought of killing myself smashed into my consciousness like a drunk driver.  Images of my tattered life boiled and raged inside my mind, and a deep, piercing pain shot through my heart.  It felt as if someone had plunged a fiery sword through my most vital organ.  I looked down at my shirt expecting to see thick, crimson blood gurgling from my chest where I knew the hole was.  Instead, all I could see was the red, white and blue Fila logo perched on my T-shirt.  I clutched my chest as I struggled to cross back over to the space in my mind that was capable of making a rational decision, but it was too late; I had already welcomed into my most sacred space the idea of ending it all – the pain, the loneliness, and the sense of abandonment that I felt.   I looked around Ralph’s basement, hoping that someone would take notice of what was going on inside of me, but they were lost in the merriment of the alcohol we had consumed that night.  Instead of alerting them that something was seriously wrong, I made a joke about what I was feeling.  With a sinister grin, I asked Ralph, Jamal and Mike what they would do if I blew my brains all over the walls of the basement.  “Nigga, you trippin,” Mike responded before taking a swig from the 40 ounce bottle of Old English 800 he had been holding.   “Don’t be playing like that,” Ralph replied with a laugh.   Jamal just looked over at me for a moment before he fired up a cigarette.  Suicide was something we never talked about, and in their case, I guess had never thought about.  Back then, I didn’t understand the power of depression and how it could lead me think about ending my life, bringing an end to the pain I had been holding inside.  My vocalizing the thought of painting the walls with my brain matter was a cry for help that none of them took seriously.  What had happened inside of us that allowed us to laugh away a question so serious? We continued to drink for another half an hour or so before Ralph decided it was time for us all to leave.  We exited his side door and headed for our respective homes.  Mike lived one block over on Murray Hill, Jamal lived two blocks over on St. Mary’s, and I lived a block in the opposite direction on Ferguson.  When we reached the corner of Midland, we exchanged pounds, then I turned and walked toward my block.  With each step I took, my feet grew heavier.  It felt like the weight of the universe was on my shoulders and I would surely buckle under the pressure.  At that moment, as I neared our house, I decided I would end it all.  I had a sawed-off shotgun beneath my mattress in the basement with plenty of shells.  A smile crossed my face as I thought about the guilt that my parents would carry around in their hearts when they found my bloody, headless body in the basement.  Maybe then they would stop and think about what they had done when they tore our family apart, and maybe for once, my mother would feel the pain that I felt as a result of her absence in my life.  The pain from my mother’s absence had crawled around inside of me like a cockroach trapped inside of a television screen.  I thought to myself, if I were no longer here, maybe she would finally think about her decision to push me out of her life and ignore me.  Maybe she would cry as she thought about all of the times she told me she wished she had never had me.  The fact that she hadn’t played a significant role in my life since their split made me believe her, and if I was unworthy of my mother’s love, I figured didn’t need to be here.  I fumbled with my keys as I struggled to let myself in the side door.  The house was quiet when I entered, but I knew that my stepsister Vanessa would be up talking on the phone.  The moment I thought about her and my nephew Megale, a tinge of guilt shot through me.  I knew she would be hurt and my nephew would be confused.  I inhaled deeply and descended the basement stairs as I stuffed my emotions back down where they couldn’t impede my progress toward death.  I didn’t bother to turn on the basement lights; I knew the layout of the basement, which doubled as my bedroom, like the back of my hand.  When I first moved in with my father, stepmother, stepsister and nephew, they showed me the area where my bedroom would be with such pride.  Instead of feeling safe and warm, I felt cold and cutoff from the rest of the house.  In my mind, the basement symbolized my standing in the family – I was at the bottom of it all.  I didn’t feel welcomed or wanted.  Instead of looking at it as though they were trying to give me a private space to call my own, I felt like a burden and that was their way of dealing with me.  My mother didn’t want me, so why would they? I plopped down in one of the big Lazy Boy chairs that made up the décor of the basement and lit up a Newport.  I allowed the calming influence of the nicotine to circulate through my body before exhaling, then closed my eyes and thought about how things had been since I moved in with my father. On the surface, everything looked good.  The house sat in the middle of a pleasant street.  My stepmother’s cooking was spectacular and my relationship with my stepsister had evolved into an ideal sibling connection.  My father and stepmother both worked for Lafayette Clinic at the time and provided us with money when they got paid.  I had enrolled in Cooley High School, made a few friends in the neighborhood and had a couple of girlfriends who skipped school with me whenever the mood struck us; however, I didn’t feel at home, and I wasn’t happy.  The longing to be loved and accepted by my mother ate at me, and I felt like an unwelcomed burden to my father and stepmother.   I knew my father and stepmother had some concerns about my behavior.  Prior to moving in with them, I had been arrested a few times for various crimes.  I was no longer the honor roll student I had been.  I rarely attended class and had lost interest in learning.  Whenever I was kicked out of school and my father had to sign me back in, I never stayed.  He would take me through the front door, and as soon as he left, I went right back out the back door.  The most troubling thing about this part of my life is that no one ever stopped to ask me what was wrong.  They never questioned how or why I had changed so dramatically in such a short span of time.  Years later, during conversations with my father, I would learn the struggles he faced trying to be a father and a recent divorcee all the while trying to make a new relationship work. As I sat there puffing on my cigarette, I began having the most negative dialogue with myself.  I thought about every beating I had endured at the hands of my mother.  I thought about the day she hurled a cast iron pot at my head after I asked her a question.  I thought about how my brothers treated me, and how they never stood up for me.  I thought of everything I could think of to make myself more miserable until I had worked up the courage to reach beneath the mattress and grab the sawed-off shotgun.  I held the heavy steel in my hands before sitting back down in the chair.  I caressed the barrel as tears began streaming from my eyes.  I remembered telling my mother that I wanted to be a doctor, and more tears fell.  I would always tell her things like that because I wanted her to love me and be proud of me more than anything in the world.  I started getting angry because I couldn’t form the words to say that she was so wrong.  In my eyes, she was blameless, so I knew there had to be something wrong with me.   I then started to think about my father and his role in the drama.  I started getting pissed at him for not being stronger in his position as head of the household.  I felt like he went along to get along.  I wanted him to come in and put his foot down when she beat my ass for nothing, but he never did.  I tried to make myself dislike him, but I couldn’t.  Despite his shortcomings, I knew that my father loved me and he was a good man.  I thought about how things were when it was just me and him, and more tears came.  I knew my death would break his heart, but I had to end the pain.  I checked the shotgun to ensure there was a slug in the chamber before taking off the safety.  I inhaled deeply and prepared to place the barrel in my mouth.  I thought about the flash of pain I would feel.  I wondered if the heat from the barrel would melt my lips when I pulled the trigger.  I had heard that the pain would be minimal, but I wasn’t quite convinced that blowing my brains out would be a painless ordeal.  I wondered how much of my head would be spread over the basement and how loud the gunshot would be.  This final thought stopped me cold.  If I blew my brains out, the sound would startle my nephew from his sleep.  I imagined my stepsister trying to calm him down, and the image of her consoling him made me put the gun back beneath the mattress.  There had to be another way.  I lit another cigarette before climbing the stairs up to the top floor.  As I walked through the house, I absorbed all of the details for what I felt would be my last time.  When I reached the upstairs bathroom, I tiptoed inside and closed the door.  I didn’t bother to cut on the bathroom light; I used the sliver of light that crept through the window from the street lamp outside.  I opened the medicine cabinet and began going through the different bottles of prescription medicine inside.  I read a few of the labels with hopes that they had a warning sign on them, letting me know just how potent they were; however, I didn’t find any that said, WARNING!  MAY CAUSE DROWSINESS.  Once I had read each label, I started searching all over again until I came across a bottle that had a lot of pills in it.  It didn’t have a warning sign, but I figured if I took enough, they would do the trick.  I removed the bottle from the cabinet and opened the top.  I poured a handful of pills in my hand and looked at myself in the mirror.  The sliver of light coming through the window gave my face a ghostly appearance; I looked as if I were already dead.  In reality, a large part of me had been dead for a couple of years.  My eyes were heavy with the sadness and loneliness of an orphan.   I took one last look at the pills in my hand, inhaled deeply, and then swallowed them greedily.  When the last pill snaked its way down my throat, I hurriedly left the bathroom and headed back downstairs to the kitchen.  I turned on the faucet and gulped down some water, trying to ensure that the pills would stay down.  When I was done, I slunk back down into the basement and waited for death to claim me.  I sat in the Lazy Boy chair and lit up another cigarette.  I puffed incessantly, hoping that I could hurry death along.  After awhile, I was struck by the thought of how unfair it would be for me to allow my two-year-old nephew to find me dead in the basement.  He was usually the first one to come downstairs in the morning.  It was one of my most pleasant experiences.  Each morning, I would lie in the bed and listen to the pitter-patter of his little feet as he navigated his way through the living room, dining room, and finally the kitchen where the stairs to the basement were located.  I could sense when something caught his attention because he would stop for a moment before continuing his journey.  When he reached the stairs, he would crawl down backwards, stopping periodically until his eyes had fully adjusted to the light.  When he reached the bottom step, he would stand up, then come over to my bed and stare at me.  Sometimes I would watch him through squinted eyes as he tried to figure out if I was awake.  Finally, he would tap me on my face and call my name.  “Uncle Jay! Uncle Jay!” he would say as he tapped my face.  “I want some cereal,” he would continue until I got up and fed him.  The thought of him not being able to awaken me caused me to jump up from the chair.  I was a bit dizzy, but I was able to make it back up the stairs.  I went straight to Vanessa’s bedroom and tapped on her door lightly.  She told me to come in, and I sat on the floor beside her bed for a minute before I said anything.  She asked me what was up.  I explained to her that I was trying to kill myself and had taken a lot of pills.  I told her that I was letting her know because I didn’t want Megale to find me dead in the morning.  She was silent for what felt like an eternity.  When she spoke, I could sense the uncertainty in her voice.  I assumed that she smelled the alcohol on my breath and may have thought that I was drunk.  She then asked me what I had done.  I told her about the pills I had taken, and that’s when she took me serious.  I told her that I was about to go back to the basement and die, and she told me that she was going to get my father.  I begged her not to, but deep inside, I was happy that she was taking action.  For the first time in a long time, I felt like someone cared about me.  I left Vanessa’s room and walked back down to the basement where I laid across my bed.  A few minutes later, I heard the heavy footsteps of my father coming down the stairs.  He hit the light switch, and the bright glare of the light caused me to scrunch my eyes into a tight ball.  “What’s wrong?” my father asked as he sat on the bed beside me.  He placed his hand on my head and checked my pulse.  I told him that I didn’t want to live any longer.  He told me that I shouldn’t say that or feel that, then started telling me about all of the things I had to live for.  He then stopped and asked me what I had taken, and I told him.  He got up and walked upstairs, and to this day, I don’t know what he went to do, but when he returned he had a cup of coffee.  He held my head and urged me to drink the coffee.  I sipped the bitter liquid as I listened to him breath deeply.  He continued to talk to me for an hour or so as we drunk coffee and smoked cigarettes.  When we realized that the pills I had taken were harmless and I wasn’t going to die, we decided to call it a night.  My father sat in the Lazy Boy chair and watched me until I fell into a fitful sleep.  The next morning, none of us mentioned anything about what had happened the night before.  There were no discussions of me getting counseling, no one asked me what I had been thinking for me to consider ending my life, and there was no call from my mother.  Vanessa never said anything about that night and neither did I.  Though I knew I wouldn’t attempt to kill myself again, I had no idea how I was going to cope with the pain that I carried around like a malignant tumor.  All I knew was that I had to find a way to get rid of what I was feeling inside.  Although I was enrolled at Cooley High School, I rarely went to class.  Whenever I decided to go up to the school, I hung out across the street behind the fruit market drinking and smoking cigarettes.  If I wasn’t hanging out at school, I was hanging with the one guy in my ‘hood that I connected with the most.  Ralph was from Long Beach, California, and had moved to the ‘hood around the same time I did.  We made friends with other guys in the neighborhood like Daniel “Big D” Lyton, who was the center for the famed Cooley High School basketball team that would go on to win three state championships while we were there.  There was also our Puritan Avenue crew who hung out on St. Mary’s every day.  On my block, there was Toke, Quinny and a few other guys I was cool with.  However, the bond that I had with Ralph was different because we were the two new guys in the ‘hood.   I had lived in a few different neighborhoods across the city so I had to learn the fine art of making friends quickly.  One of the things that I realized from past experiences, however, was that no matter how cool I was with the guys in the new ‘hood, I would never have the history that they had with each other.  As we got older, this became evident as beefs and rifts occurred between me, Ralph and the rest of the guys on my block.  With Big D, it was different because he was more mature than the rest of the guys on the block.  Our bond was solid and we would always kick it whenever I showed up at school or hang out when he got his father’s van.  The thing that really cemented our bond was our love for hip hop and street culture.  We would walk up to the record shop anytime one of us had some extra money and cop whatever new rap album came out.  After that, we would sit in my basement and dub tapes for each other as we ate my stepmother’s cooking.  Our bond remained solid over the years, but I was growing apart from the rest of the ‘hood.   Ralph and I began dabbling in the dope game again.  I sold weed at school and we hung out with my older brothers in a neighborhood called Brightmoor.  My sister Tamica was the first of my siblings to move to this gritty neighborhood at the far west end of the city.  She lived on a street named Blackstone, which became one of my favorite places to hang out.  It reminded me of my old neighborhood on the east side, and every chance I got, I called my brother Alan to come get me so that I could hang out in Brightmoor.  He had a house a couple of streets over from my sister on Patton near Lyndon, so if I wasn’t hanging on Blackstone with Tamica, I was at Alan’s house.  He was selling weight and the house was cranking.  I loved sitting at the dining room table with my brothers counting money, but I loved spending the money they gave me even more.  When I went up to Cooley, I would wear the newest Troop apparel they had bought for me, or whatever else was out at the time, and I always had money to drink and eat at the Coney Island.  Around that same time, things had started to heat up in Brightmoor.  One day, I noticed a car sitting a couple of houses down with four guys in it.  They looked suspicious so I told my brother Alan about the car.  I didn’t know if they were police or not, but I wanted to give my brother a heads up.  He checked it out and said he didn’t know what was up but I shouldn’t worry about it.  We went back to doing what we were doing, then decided to order a pizza.  When the pizza arrived, his girlfriend Teresa got a few plates out for her children and us, and we started eating.  Before I could get the second slice down, the sound of a loud crash burst through the air.   “Police! Police!” the voices screamed out as several men barged into the house.  We froze in our tracks and placed our hands on top of our heads.  The first guy to reach me pushed me into the wall before snatching the gold rope that I wore from around my neck.   “Hit the safe in the bedroom,” I heard a muffled voice say as two men started ransacking the back bedroom.  Once they grabbed the safe and started to flee, it dawned on me that we were being robbed.  On their way out, one of the guys carrying the safe hit me in the head before he exited.  That’s when Alan sprung into action.  He grabbed a pistol out of the closet and ran out of the door, but it was too late.  They were gone.   Immediately, we started thinking about who could have put together the robbery.  We called my brother Art and sat at the dining room table thinking about who had put the play down.  My brother was relieved that no one had gotten hurt and they hadn’t gotten away with anything other than the necklace they had snatched from my neck.  A couple of hours before the robbery, my brother Art had come over and picked up the money, so their plan came up short. When we finished talking, we concluded that the only person it could be was a guy named Mike who lived a few doors down.  He had sold Art a few guns and was one of the only people outside of family who had seen the location of the safe.   We sat outside waiting for Mike to return home.  When he did, we went down to his house.  I carried a rifle and both of my brothers had pistols with them.  We accused him of setting up the robbery and threatened to kill him if we didn’t get the necklace back.  We were beyond reckless and allowed the emotions of the moment to dictate our actions.  Mike stuck to his guns and assured us that he hadn’t had anything to do with the robbery.  After a few minutes and a few more threats, we left and went back to the house.  Moments later, while we were sitting in the living room talking about the incident, Mike came back down to the house.  Before he could get two words out, Art began shooting at him with a .357 Magnum.   The sound of the gunshots caused the house to shake.  Teresa grabbed her children and ran for cover as me and Alan looked on.  For Alan, that was the beginning of the ending.  There was no way he could leave his girl and her children at the house with a full-fledged beef going on.  For the rest of the night, we remained vigilant, but things on Patton were never the same.  We continued to make money over there until Alan was picked up for a parole violation.  He was extradited back to Illinois where he had served time on two other occasions and was sentenced to serve more time.  We were saddened to see our brother go back to prison, but we continued to live the lifestyle.  With Alan locked up, me and Art began spending more time together.  Everyday, he would come and get me from my father’s house and we would ride around all day picking up money and dropping off drugs.  When we weren’t handling business, we went skating at Northland Roller Rink during the weekdays and Rolladium out in Pontiac every Sunday, which is where we hung out with our homeboys Billy Davis, Jesse Peeples and Terrance Majors from our old neighborhood on the east side.  For the first time ever, me and Art started hanging out everyday.  I was getting older and able to hold my own so he liked having me around.  But as they say, good things always come to an end.  The more I hung with Art, the more I became a victim of he-say, she-say in the ‘hood.  Some guys that lived down the block from me on Ferguson had an issue with me hanging with my crew from Puritan, even though I was barely in the ‘hood.  Then one day, things got heated and we got into a shootout over some trifling neighborhood gossip.  When Vanessa caught wind of the shootout, she called Art and told him what happened.  When he came over to the house, I was a couple of blocks over on St. Mary’s with the rest of the crew talking about the shootout.   Art pulled up and told me to get in the car.  He asked me what was going on as we pulled off.  I gave him the rundown and he started going off on me about hanging out with my crew.  He never liked crowds, and back then, I didn’t understand his line of reasoning.  When we neared the corner, the guys from down the street were coming up the side street.  Their older brother was leading the way.  When Art saw them, he pulled over and started talking to their older brother.  The conversation started off cool.  Their brother said he was coming around the corner to squash the beef, but as he talked, one of their cousins began running off at the mouth.  Art got tired of listening to the shit talking and pulled off.  When we neared the corner of the next block, he hit a U-turn and pressed down hard on the accelerator.  Before they could get out of the way, he had run a few of them over.  Just as we were driving through the crowd, one of the guys started shooting.  The car window exploded as Art yelled for me to get down.  When we got to my street, Art told me he had been hit.  We had a female named Peaches with us, and her and I rushed him to the hospital.  We checked him in under an alias so that he could get treated for a gunshot wound to the arm.  They told him that he had to stay overnight so I went back to the ‘hood, got Ralph and we drove back to the hospital.  We asked Art if he wanted us to go back and shoot one of them, but he told us to leave it alone until he got released from the hospital.   The following day, me and Peaches picked Art up from the hospital, then picked up some money before heading over to Art’s ex-girlfriend’s house.  He had gotten the car in her name and wanted her to call the insurance company to get the window fixed.  They got into an argument and he ended up slapping her around.  Shortly thereafter, we left her house and headed to his apartment to chill.  While we were kicking it, Art said that he had a feeling his ex-girlfriend was going to call the police because she knew he had a warrant out for his arrest.  Despite this, we remained at the apartment.  I ran a few errands for him while Peaches took care of him.  When I returned, me and Peaches sat on the couch kicking it.  Art was just coming out of the bedroom when he heard a loud knock at the door.   “Police! Come out with your hands up!” they ordered through the door as they beat on it frantically.  “Fuck y’all, I ain’t going to jail,” Art said as he scrambled back into his bedroom.  Peaches started crying and my heart began pounding as I thought about us all dying in a hail of bullets.  Art reemerged from the bedroom and looked out of the kitchen window into the parking lot, which was surrounded by police cars.   “Damn, why you have to be here little bro,” he said as he held a carbine in his hand. After a few tense moments, Art realized that he was out of options unless he was ready to die.  He told them that he was about to open the door.  He hugged me and told me to call our father to let him know what was up.  He then opened the door for the police to enter.  They rushed him like a rugby player, and in a matter of moments, all I could see was a pile of blue uniforms and the soles of my brother’s shoes beneath the pile. A couple of officers came over and told me to get up against the wall as they began searching the apartment.  They found a pistol beneath the couch that I was sitting on and a few automatic rifles in the front closet.  In the bedroom, they found more guns and a scale.  One of the officers said that he could charge me with the gun that was beneath the sofa, but my brother told them that everything in the house belonged to him.  When they were finished searching the apartment, they took him out in handcuffs and told me and Peaches that we had to leave the premises.  Peaches and I caught a cab to my father’s house.  When I told him the news about Art getting locked up, he was livid.  He started fussing at me for hanging out with Art and warned me that I was going to follow him to prison if I continued down the path I was on.  I allowed his words to flow in one ear and out the other.   In less than a one-year span, both of my brothers had gone to prison, and as prophesized, it wouldn’t be long before I followed suit.  It had become clear that me moving back home was not working out.  My father and I began clashing over everything.  Then, him and my stepmother separated, and he and I moved into an apartment on Greenfield and Plymouth; however, I was still hanging in the ‘hood or down in Brightmoor.   Things cooled down for a moment until I caught a felonious assault case for which they had a warrant out for my arrest. It started over a petty beef between my neighbor Desmond and one of my homeboys named Boo Boo who lived a few blocks over.  One day, Boo Boo came over to my house drunk and decided to kick my neighbor’s door in. They thought I had something to do with Boo Boo’s actions and decided to retaliate by beating on our door at three or four o’clock in the morning.  I came running out with a pistol and confronted my neighbors.  Desmond’s mother denied knowing anything about them coming to our house, but I could hear him and his friend from down the street talking in the background and I vowed to beat their ass when I caught them.  My father had rushed out the house behind me and forced me to go back inside.  A few weeks later, I caught Desmond and his friend slipping and beat his friend in the head with a bat.  He was rushed to the hospital and a warrant was issued for my arrest. I wasn’t prepared to go to jail so I stopped coming home and started hanging down in Brightmoor exclusively.  I had tired of all the drama at home and asked my sister Tamica if I could stay with her for awhile.  It was 1989, and I was one month shy of my seventeenth birthday. I had no idea that my birthday surprise would be the beginning of the end of my life on the streets. Chapter 12 The thought of robbing another inmate had never occurred to me until I was discussing my financial predicament with my bunky Murder.  I told him how things had gone with the money Brenda was supposed to send me, and he told me that he was in the same position.  Neither of us had been assigned a job yet and our only source of income was our family and loved ones.  Unfortunately, neither of us had received a money order in time to make it to the store, which we were only allowed to do every two weeks.  We were running low on cigarettes and neither of us was in a position to borrow money from other inmates because we didn’t know when our next money order would arrive.   This was one of the many sad realities of being locked up.  It didn’t take a whole lot to survive financially in prison, but we couldn’t even count on our so-called friends to drop a hot twenty dollars on our books.  The more I thought about how much money I used to spend at the corner store on a daily basis, the angrier I became at the thought of my friends not sending me money.  We used to drink fifths of liquor, forty ounces of beer, smoke cigarettes and weed every day, but the way I saw it, I wasn’t worth sacrificing one trip to the store in their eyes.   I sat up kicking it with Murder about being betrayed by our homies and our families.  We used that conversation to fuel our anger and reinforce our fuck-the-world mentality.  By the time we finished talking, it was late into the night and we had devised a plan to rob our neighbor after he picked up his store items.  He was a middle-aged White man running his own black market store so we felt doubly justified in robbing him.  We talked about how he would give the other brothers one store item for two items in return and then talk down to them when they didn’t have what they owed him.  He was no different than the other brothers on the cellblock who thought nothing of busting another brother’s head or stabbing him to death over a pack of cigarettes; however, in our mind, his White skin put him in the same class as the White officers who policed the prison.   We agreed that I would run into the cell and subdue our neighbor while Murder relieved him of all of his store goods.  We hung around our cell watching his every move while also watching the movement of the officer responsible for our tier.  When we noticed our neighbor headed for the shower, we knew the timing was right.   We eased back into our cell and cracked the door.  I told Murder to look out for the officer once our neighbor returned from the shower and give me a minute to walk past his cell so I could check out the scene.  Once our neighbor was in his cell, I stepped out and walked past to see where he was in the cell.  I had to walk a little ways down the hall to play it off, and when I turned around, I was shocked to see Murder halfway inside the cell telling the guy to run all of his commissary.  While Murder was talking, he was also trying to watch out for the police, and that’s when our neighbor took advantage and tried to land a punch.  I pulled Murder out of the way and delivered a punch to the guy that knocked him into the cell door.  He staggered and covered his face, then Murder jumped on his back and tried choking him as he pulled him back into the cell.  We were making a lot of noise, so I tried to silence the guy with a few more punches.  What started off as a robbery attempt had quickly escalated into a full on assault; we got caught up in the adrenaline rush and forgot what we had come for.   Just as I started measuring the guy up for a good punch, someone jumped on my back.  All I could do was think about his bunky sneaking up on me from behind as I felt someone pulling at my arms.  I quickly leaned forward, causing the person on my back to stumble forward.  I then reached behind me and flipped who I thought was the guy’s bunky over on his back.  It was then that I realized it wasn’t his bunky after all; it was one of the officers working the unit.  Before reality of what I had just done could kick in, I was rushed to the wall by several other officers and handcuffed.   More officers rushed to the unit, grabbed Murder and threw him in handcuffs.  As we were being led away from the unit, we could hear the cackling over the radio.  The officers had to send out an emergency call to the infirmary because our neighbor had begun having a seizure.  The officer who had me by the cuffs told me that I was going to be charged with murder if the guy died enroute to the hospital.   “I don’t give a fuck. I ain’t never going home anyway,” I snapped, in an effort to take back some control of the situation. The officer ignored my bravado, as he had seen and heard it all before and knew better than us that we really did care, or at least wanted to.  When I got to the segregation unit, I was placed in a shower cage where I stayed in handcuffs for fifteen minutes.  Finally, after what felt like an eternity, a hound dog-faced officer came to the shower cage and ordered me to back up so that he could take the handcuffs off of my wrists.  I backed up to the slot and put my hands up so that he could take the cuffs off.  He put the key in and freed my right hand while tightly holding the cuff. “So you like to assault White men, huh? You lil’ asshole,” the officer said as he snatched the cuff through the slot, bringing with it my arm, which he pulled downward in a jerking motion.   “Bitch, when they let me out of the hole, I’m going to kill your hoe ass,” I promised through clenched teeth as I felt the skin tearing from my arm and my bone threatening to snap.  “Next time, you’ll think twice about who you put your hands on dickhead,” he snapped back with a smirk as he released my hand from the cuff.   As I wrapped my shirt around my arm to stymie the flow of blood, I continued to curse and tell the officer what I was going to do to him when I got out of the hole.  When the other officers came to take me to a cell, my body became very tense.  I didn’t know what they would try to do to me.  They were White like the first officer, and I didn’t know if they held the same sentiments, so when they told me to turn around and place my hands behind my back, I hesitated.  It was then that one of the officers noticed me bleeding and asked if I wanted to see a nurse.  Something about him showing concern caused me to relax.  I told him that I was okay and allowed him to cuff me up.   Even though I knew that the other officer was wrong, I wasn’t about to rat him out.  It wouldn’t have brought me any pleasure, even if he were suspended.  The only thing that would have given me pleasure was beating his ass, and I knew his co-workers weren’t going to allow that to happen, so I chalked it up to the game.   As I was being escorted to a cell, one of the officers asked me why I was wasting my young life.  This was a question I had been asked quite often when I was young, and I never had an answer.  All I knew was that I was hurt inside and didn’t give a fuck about living or dying.  I felt like my life was over, so there was nothing more to waste.  The officer went on to mention that they had escorted our neighbor to the hospital and it wasn’t looking good for us.  When I entered the cell, I sat down on the bunk and thought briefly about what my father would think when he learned that I had been charged with another count of murder.  Though I didn’t think at that time that I was ever getting out of prison, I didn’t want to kill anyone, especially not over a bag of commissary.  I stood looking out of the window for what felt like hours before a sergeant came to my cell and read off the charges. I was given a major misconduct for assault on staff, assault on an inmate and dangerous contraband for a weapon they discovered in my cell.  Within two days, I was transferred back to MR along with Murder.                One evening after chow, I was told to pack up all of my property; I was getting transferred in the morning back to the Michigan Reformatory in Ionia where I would be placed on long-term segregation status.  In prison vernacular, we called it “lay down.”  When I first came to the hole, I asked one of the inmates who had been in prison for a while why they had given it that name.  He responded with a laugh before saying, “Because down here, all you can do is lay your ass down and read, lay your ass down and write, or lay your ass down and talk shit all day.  So it’s up to you young blood how you do it, but all I can tell you is, don’t take this shit laying down.”  The administration, on the other hand, chose to use the much more lofty euphemism “administrative segregation.”  It sounded politically correct and oh so professional, but when they weren’t on record, they called it the “hole” just like the rest of us.    During the forty-minute ride back to Ionia, thoughts of what the “hole” would be like tumbled through my head like a gymnast.  Horror stories of how inmates in the hole had been found hung in their cells, or mysteriously suffocated with their own socks, or how the officers would come in your cell with the goon squad and beat you two breaths short of death, all ran tirelessly through my mind.  What about all of the resistance I had put up?  What if the officers at the other prison had called their buddies to give me a nice work over?  After being processed, I was escorted to the hole into a cellblock known as the “Graves.”  It had earned the moniker from the inmates there because once you were thrown in the “Graves,” it was like being entombed in a place where you lost sight of time.  It was as though you were dead to everyone in general population, and the cells were so small that you felt like you had been squeezed into a coffin.  Essentially, being sentenced to “lay down” was to be sentenced to an indeterminate amount of time in hell.   Before the reality of what I was about to experience kicked in, an officer told me that the sheriffs were there to pick me up and take me on a writ to the county jail.  The first thought that ran through my mind was the inmate who I had assaulted had died.  It took a minute for me to realize that it was the Wayne County Sheriffs, which meant I was going back to Detroit.  I breathed a sigh of relief as I prepared for what turned out to be several months of me going back and forth to the Wayne County Jail.  After my first trip to the county, I was returned about a week later and tossed back into the Graves. The first thing I noticed when I entered the cellblock was the gloomy ambiance.  The windows were painted a somber gray and the only natural light present was the few streams that snuck through when the officers were nice enough to leave one of the windows cracked, which was very rare.  Being stripped of all personal belongings, with the exception of the bare necessities, made it impossible to tell if it was morning or night unless you asked the officers or the windows were open.  Other than that, I had to guess the time based on when my meals were passed out.    As I was escorted down to my cell, I had to navigate my way around spoiled food, empty milk cartons, fecal-stained towels, and piles of shredded and soiled paper.  I kept my head straightforward as I walked toward my cell, but out of the corner of my eye, I could see several inmates standing at their bars looking out curiously.  I had learned from day one inside of the Reformatory not to look into another inmate’s cell.  It was an old code of respect.  Since we were already being deprived of so much by the system, we didn’t want to deny each other the last semblance of privacy, so we didn’t look into each other’s cell.  Not everyone stayed true to this code, and it was often the cause of conflict, leading the Peeping Tom to be stabbed on the yard, or flashed with genitalia.  I had no desire to see another man shaking his private parts in anger, nor did I have a desire to stab anyone or get stabbed for looking in someone’s cell, so I always kept my head forward. When I reached my cell, the bars squeaked open and the officer ordered me to step inside.  Once the bars closed shut, he removed the handcuffs and left.  I looked around at the dingy cell in disgust.  The bed was six inches off of the floor and the toilet was stuffed behind a small footlocker.  In order to sit down and take a dump, I had to remove my whole jumpsuit so that I could fold my legs behind the locker.    After my initial observations, I stood at my cell bars for the next hour waiting on the officer to make his rounds so that I could get some cleaning supplies to sanitize my cell.  To my surprise, it was relatively quiet, but as I would soon learn, this was the calm before the storm.  Most of the inmates in the hole slept the bulk of their days away, only waking up to get their food trays.  Once the final meal of the day was passed out, the cellblock would come alive with activity. When the officer returned, I asked him for some cleaning supplies and was informed that the porters would pass them out after lunch, so I continued to stand at the bars until lunch.  There was no way I was going to sit or lay down on a mattress that someone else had sweated and farted on without it being sanitized.  When the porters arrived with our food trays, I took mine and stood at the bars eating the hastily thrown together meal.  The portions were nearly a half-size smaller than what I was used to receiving in general population, but I devoured the small meal in all of five minutes like a ravenous wolf, then placed my tray on the bars.  I didn’t really like drinking milk all that much, so I left the carton sitting on the locker.  When they came around to pick up trays, one of the porters whispered that I had better hide the milk in my locker unless I wanted to be placed on food loaf.  I placed the milk back on the tray as I looked at him curiously.  I had never heard of food loaf, but from the way he conveyed the message, I could tell it was something very bad.  His “man, you crazy” look was also letting me know that it in the hole, no food was to be wasted.  That milk I threw back on the tray could have bought me a bag of cereal, a juice, or an extra piece of toast.  In the hole, everything pertaining to eating and smoking was to be bartered and nothing was to be wasted.  Once they banned smoking, a cigarette smuggled in could net you three dollars in store items. It was in the hole that I learned to start eating Brussel sprouts and dressing and a few other things I would have never eaten had I been in general population.  Every time I ate green beans or Brussel sprouts, I thought about all of the times that my parents tried to get me to eat them when I was a child, and I hung my head in shame.   After the trays were picked up, a porter came back and handed me some cleaning supplies.  I swept beneath the small bunk and was surprised at how much dirt and dust came from under the bed.  I washed the mattress, toilet and sink down, then made up my bed.  After I cleaned up and laid back on the bunk, I drifted off into a fitful sleep.   My mind was full of thoughts that I had stuffed deep down inside where they were safe.  All of the issues that I had run from while I was in general population – either by watching television or playing basketball to exhaustion – now came rushing back to the forefront of my mind. I dreamt of how soft Brenda’s lips used to feel against mine.  I dreamt of how good it used to feel to guzzle down an ice cold 40 ounce on a hot summer day.  I dreamt of the late night laughter that echoed through the ‘hood as we sat on the porch at two o’clock in the morning playing the dozens.  My dreams were a kaleidoscope of all that my life had been, and all that it could have been.  \t I was awakened by the sound of the chow cart squeaking down the tier.  I retrieved my tray and sucked down the bland slop that they called dinner, and this time, I drank the milk.  Despite my aversion to plain milk, it sure beat the brownish water that drizzled out of the old porcelain sink in my cell.  I sat the tray on the bars, laid back on my bunk, and forced myself back to sleep in an attempt to retrieve those lost and stolen dreams, but to no avail.  After the officers picked up the food trays, they passed out mail and the cellblock was pretty quiet for the next few hours.  The hum of a few conversations could be heard as inmates discussed religion, politics, and stories of their lives on the streets.  Stories shared between inmates were our way of staying connected to the neighborhoods we came from.  It was one of the few means we had to touch, taste and smell our former lives, if only for a few minutes.  It didn’t matter if you were a part of the conversation or not, you could relate, because when it was all said and done, most Black communities were pretty much the same.  So when I sat back on my bunk listening to a guy from Flint, Saginaw or Lansing talking about their neighborhoods and what they had been through, it was like reliving my own memories of life before prison.   \tOne of the things about prison is that you have some very amusing storytellers with expansive imaginations who are capable of creating the kind of vivid imagery that would put Hollywood screenwriters to shame.  I have always marveled at how a person could remember the exact color of their socks, how much money they had in their pocket to the nearest dime, and all of the ingredients used to make the meal they had on the day they got shot, had sex for the first time, or made their first thousand.  When retelling a story, everyone has a tendency to embellish things a little, but in the hole there were a few inmates who were infamous for their ability to tell a lie-filled story that was so entertaining, each night everyone would grow quiet as they recounted their neighborhood exploits.   \tAs the voices hummed about from cell to cell, I found myself thinking about how I had arrived at this point in my life.  Growing up, I never imagined that I would be living my life out caged in a cell like a wild animal.  “I am too smart for this shit,” I thought angrily as I stared up at the paint-chipped ceiling.  No matter how many times I closed and opened my eyes, however, my nightmarish existence was still there.   After speaking with several inmates at length, I realized that most of us go through this extreme feeling of disbelief.  At some point, we all think this is a nightmare, and at any moment, we will awaken and be back home in the warm comfort of our own bed; however, after years of incarceration, we all learn that prison is all too real.  And for me, things were about to get more real than I could have ever imagined.  After getting bored listening to the monotonous conversations going on around me, I decided to get up and write a few letters.  The first, I wrote to Brenda, and then to my ex-girlfriend Nycci.  Before I knew it, I was writing everyone I knew.  The hours spun past quickly as I scratched out letter after letter with a dull two-inch pencil.   \tWhen the third shift came on at ten o’clock, I was still immersed in writing letters.   It was through writing letters home that I realized writing was my escape.  With a pen and piece of paper, I could get away whenever I wanted to.  I could stand on the corner in my neighborhood and no one could stop me.  I could drive down the freeway to go see my ex-girlfriend in Ohio if that’s what I wanted to do, and the bars and wired fences couldn’t hold me back.  Writing was freedom.  So I wrote until midnight when they cut off the power and my fingers became sore to the bone.  \tWhen the lights went out, the cellblock had an eerie feel to it.  I was on the bottom tier toward the end and there were no lights in the hall near my cell, so I couldn’t stand at the bars and read or write like guys who had lights in front of their cell.  I climbed into my bunk and prayed that I could drift off into a deep sleep before the dreams of my life before prison came back to haunt me.  I had to get away from them; otherwise I knew that I would go insane.  There was nothing I could do to change my reality, and I didn’t need to be constantly reminded by my dreams.   \tAs I lay there trying to capture sleep, the world around me exploded into chaos.  “Get y’all bitch ass up.  Ain’t no sleep around here,” a loud voice called, followed by a sound as loud and startling as a shotgun blast in a small church.  Boom!  Boom!  Boom!  The sound came relentlessly as the voice banged the lid down on his footlocker over and over, which set into motion a chain of events unlike anything I had ever imagined.   \tFor the next four hours, the hole became an anarchist stronghold as inmates banged lockers and hurled racial epithets and disparaging homosexual remarks through the air like hand grenades.  Some stuffed their toilets with sheets and flushed until water cascaded over the tier like Victoria Falls.  I stared out of my cell in disbelief as the floor quickly became a small wading pool.  Trash and sheets that had been set on fire flew out of countless cells.  After their initial attempts to restore order by turning off the water supply to all of the cells, the officers threw in the towel.  As dawn slowly crept upon us, everyone settled down and the cellblock grew quiet again.   \tThe only thing that seemed to be stirring was a giant rat the size of a possum, which the inmates had named “Food Loaf,” after the loaf of bread-sized brick of mashed up food that was fed to recalcitrant inmates.  I watched as Food Loaf sludged through the murky water to retrieve the soggy bread and rotted apple cores that had been thrown out onto the cellblock floors.  He moved with a quiet confidence about him that came as a result of being around hundreds of people every day.  The rest of the vermin that darted in and out of the cells were more cautious.  \tI often wondered why no one had killed Food Loaf, but then it dawned on me.  In a lot of ways, he was a lot like us.  He was an outcast, and for the most part, everyone despised him, and we could all identify with that.  Though the term “rat” had been used over the years to describe someone who told on others to protect their own ass, Food Loaf had won over our respect and was therefore allowed to coexist with us.  His mousy cousins weren’t as fortunate, however.  Every opportunity we had, we killed them because they were invasive of our territory.  It’s hard to get along with vermin when they get in your bed at night or nibble on the food you had stored away to get through another day.   \tMy days in the Graves were pretty much the same, night in and night out.  After a few days, I too learned how to sleep through the mornings and afternoons.  After nearly six of months of transferring back and forth between Wayne County Jail and the Graves, I was transferred to Standish Maximum Security Facility where a whole new level of hell awaited me.   Chapter 13 \t From the moment my sister Tamica moved on Blackstone in the heart of Brightmoor, I fell in love with the neighborhood that sat at the farthest end of Detroit’s west side.  Initially, I had gone over there to hang out with Tamica and her husband, but it wasn’t long before I started connecting with guys in the neighborhood.  I knew most of her neighbors from when I used to visit, but one day I noticed that a new family had moved across the street.  I established an immediate bond with Mack, who was one of three Cooper brothers.  We were both into music, fighting pit bulls, and drinking everyday.  He introduced me to his older brother Coop, his mother Ms. Cooper, his twin sisters Karen and Sharon, and younger brother Boe.   \tOnce I started hanging out down there on a regular basis, I also reconnected with what turned out to be my best friend in Brightmoor, Mark Bosley.  He introduced me to the rest of his family, including his brothers Jimmy, Sean, Andre, and Michael, his sister Kenyatta, and their mother Mrs. Bosley.  They all started hanging out at Tamica’s house and we developed a strong bond between all of our families.   \tEverybody was hustling rocks on the corner of Blackstone, and the street stayed abuzz with drug activity.  Even though Boe was the younger brother, he was the major supplier for his brothers.  Initially, I just hung out and watched them make money, but after awhile, I started getting dope from my old neighborhood and selling my own rocks on the block with everyone else.   \tThe summer was heating up and I could sense that Boe wasn’t feeling me selling dope on the block where he had established things, but I continued to sell rocks on my own for a while.  The way I saw it, there was enough money for all of us because we had some of the most loyal customers and one of the hottest blocks in the D when it came to selling crack.  On any given day, you would see dozens of customers lined up on our block, and we didn’t hesitate to serve them up.  Within a year and a half, we had built a solid family-like vibe with everyone on our block.  No matter what someone needed, we knew someone in the crew would take care of it.  \t Our neighbors who weren’t involved in the trade embraced us like family because we were always there to bail them out financially.  If they had more bills than money, they knew that they could borrow from us until their payday.  We also took care of the children on the block, buying them ice cream daily and saving their family a few dollars a week, which meant a lot to families who were barely getting by.   We had a very distorted approach to life.  On one hand, we were being neighborly and taking care of the people who lived on our street, but on the other hand, we were destroying our community.  When we got into shootouts, we didn’t think about the possibility of a stray bullet hitting someone that we loved or the reality that we were making the children hostages in their homes when a beef was on.   \tWe also didn’t think about the bandits and thugs that we brought around our loved ones, or the fact that we were taking food out of the mouths of the kids who looked up to us.  This sickness was so deeply entrenched in our young hearts and minds that we never gave thought to the fact that someone, at any given moment, could run up in either of the houses we hung out at and start shooting.  For a while, none of these things mattered to us; we were all about making money, having fun, and chasing the street dream.  It wouldn’t be long before our dreams turned into nightmares for all of us.  Within a few months, we were hit with tragedy after tragedy, and our families were forced to deal with the fallout. \tNot long after we met, Boe was shot and his best friend was murdered by his sister’s boyfriend over an argument about money that Boe was owed.  It was a sobering moment for the Cooper family and it was only through the Creator’s grace that Boe didn’t die that day.  During that time, Boe and I weren’t close, so I just played the background and offered my support to his brothers.  I let them know that if he needed me to retaliate, I was available.  My loyalty to the Cooper brothers was extended to Boe even though we weren’t cool at the time.   \tAfter the shooting, Boe started hanging over on the block more often and we began developing a lukewarm relationship.  In the meantime, my bond with Mark had grown to the point where we were like brothers and nearly inseparable.  If I was walking down the street, you could trust that Mark wasn’t far behind, and it was the same with Mark.  Wherever you saw one of us, you knew the other wasn’t far behind.  In reality, that was the first time I felt like I had a brother who I could relate to like family.  My biological brothers were older, and they weren’t into the things I was into, so Mark filled that void.  \tOne night, we were at Tamica’s house kicking it about how we would get rich selling dope or rapping.  The conversation was going good and the drinks were flowing. It was a nice spring night and everyone was enjoying themselves.  Unfortunately, it wasn’t long before an argument broke out between Mark and his younger brother Jimmy, who was also my close friend.  Tamica told them to take it outside, so everyone started going outside.  I grabbed a jacket and rushed out of the door in an effort to break up the fight.  I didn’t realize it at the time, but I had stashed some crack in the jacket over the winter.   \tWhile we were standing outside trying to convince Mark and Jimmy not to fight, the police had crept around the corner with their lights off.  By the time we realized that they were on the block, it was too late.  They whipped up on us and hit the spotlight.  Jimmy was still going haywire. The police jumped out and told all of us to get up against the car.  Another one of our homeboys named Orlando tried to toss a sack of rocks beneath the car, but it ricocheted off of the tire and bounced right in front of a female officer.  Her partner then began searching all of us aggressively.   When the officer reached me, I was as calm as a cucumber because I knew I had sold out of the rocks I had earlier that day.  He turned my pants pockets inside out like rabbit ears, searched my boxers, and then patted my jacket down.  When he hit my left side, I felt something brush up against my side. The blood nearly drained from my face when he reached inside of my pocket and pulled out a bag of crumbled rocks.  Before I could even begin to explain, he had the cuffs on me and was stuffing me in the back of the squad car.   \tOrlando and I were taken to the 8th Precinct where we stayed overnight.  The following morning we were taken to the Wayne County Youth Home on 1333 E. Forest.  When we arrived, Orlando’s family was there to post bond and take him home.  I knew that my parents weren’t coming to get me, however.  My father had told me from day one that he would come see me, but he would never bail me out if I got locked up, so I had no expectation of getting out.  When we approached the desk, we went through the preliminaries and the woman doing intake asked if I had any injuries.  I told her that my hand was swollen from a fight that I had had a few days before.  When she looked at my hand, she told the officers that she couldn’t admit me without me getting medical treatment. So the officers transferred me to Receiving Hospital where they put me in a holding cell until the doctor was ready to see me.   When the doctor finally arrived, the officers brought me out of the holding cell, handcuffed me, and then shackled me to a gurney.  I remained like that until my mother came and got me.  They released me into her custody after they determined I needed surgery on my hand.  As soon as she got me out, I was right back on the block; being chained to a bed wasn’t enough to deter me from the path of destruction I was on.   \tA couple weeks later, I went to court on the drug charge and the judge sent you to the youth home while I awaited my trial.  I was crushed when I realized I would be locked up for the entire summer.   When I first entered the youth home, I was shocked when they told me to strip so that they could spray me down with disinfectant.  I felt like a dog getting hosed down in the backyard.   I was then sent to 4C, which was a unit for violent offenders.  I was one of the older guys on the unit, not only in age, but also in maturity.  Everyday there was either a fight on our unit or between our unit and the other units.   After a few weeks in the youth home, I was sent back to court.  I had just turned 17 so the judge gave me two options – go to a juvenile detention center or enter Job Corps.  I had had enough of lock up, so I told her that I would go to Job Corps.  She told me that I had to report to Job Corps within two weeks or she would issue a warrant and have me rearrested and charged.  She was willing to give me a second chance, even when I wasn’t willing to give myself a second chance.  \tTwo weeks later, I enrolled in Job Corps.  I just knew that I would still be able to hang out in the ‘hood because there was a Job Corps on Jefferson on the city’s east side.  When I got ready to enroll, the staff told me that the judge’s instructions indicated that I could go to any Job Corps in the country, except for the one in Detroit.  I nearly broke down in tears when they told me that the only one with an immediate opening was located in Prestonburg, Kentucky, and it was one of the only all-male programs.  I wanted to run out of the door and head back to the ‘hood right then, but when I looked up at my father, I knew that I had to do the responsible thing and go.   \tMy father was always by my side no matter what trouble I got myself into and came to see me at the youth home every chance he got.  I had promised him that I would get my life together, and this was my first chance to show and prove.  I filled out the necessary paperwork and was told that I would be leaving in two days.  I went back to the ‘hood and got drunk with my crew for the last time, then went and chilled with my girlfriend Shelly.  My father, stepmother and Shelly took me to the Greyhound bus station where we cried and hugged until it was time for me to board the bus.  I looked down at my paperwork like where the fuck is Prestonburg.  As I sat in my seat looking out at my family, I reasoned with myself that I was taking a step toward a brighter future.  What I didn’t realize was that I was about to take a trip back into the past – the deep, dark, racist past of America. Chapter 14 \t It was a relatively warm and sunny fall day when I was transferred to Standish Maximum Security Prison.  I was a year into my prison sentence and a few months past my twentieth birthday.  Instead of entering my sophomore year in college, I was shipped to a prison designed to house the worst of the worst.  Upon my arrival at the newly designed facility, I was brought into the control center where several officers stood around glaring at me.  I maintained a stoic expression as they talked their tough correctional officer talk.  I was no longer new to the psychological warfare that the officers waged against the inmates.  This was a protracted war of attrition that had been going on since the first prison was built over a century ago.  As I glanced around at all of the technology, an officer began removing the black box that was wrapped around my handcuffs to prevent an escape.   \tOnce he removed the black box, another officer approached with a pair of handcuffs that were attached to what looked like a dog leash.  This was the first time I had seen anything like it, and my immediate thought was that it had to be in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  But I guess in the prisoncrat’s mind, being leashed like a dog didn’t violate Article 5 of the Univeral Declaration of Human Rights, which states, “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”     \tDespite what prison officials thought, I definitely felt degraded.  I mean, how could I not feel degraded when I was being treated like a common house pet?  One officer placed the handcuffs on me as the other officer removed the first pair.  They did this in a synchronized way to minimize the time in which either of my hands was free from the other.  After removing one pair of shackles and replacing them with another, the officers chatted with each other before the transfer officers left. I was then taken to the hole in cellblock one.  I shuffled along in the shackles as two officers held on tightly to the leash that was attached to my handcuffs until I reached the unit.  All was relatively quiet when I first stepped into the cellblock.  The design of the prison was totally different from the Reformatory, which was over one hundred years old.  Inside the unit, there were four wings – two upper wings and two lower wings.  I was taken to the lower wing on one side of the unit.    \tThe first thing I noticed was that the hallways were free of debris, and instead of bars, there were large steel doors with window covers on them.    Once I reached what would be my cell, the officer in the control bubble hit a button, the cell door slid open, and I was ordered to step inside. Once inside, the door slid shut behind me with a finality that still resonates inside of me to this day.  As the officer removed the handcuffs and shackles and prepared to leave, I asked him if my window shutter could remain open and he said no, then banged it shut.     \tFor the first time in my short incarceration, I felt alone as I looked around the Spartan-like cell.  A flat green mattress lay folded on top of a thick slab of concrete that protruded from the side wall.  Another shorter slab of concrete protruded from the back wall over the concrete bed, and I soon discovered this was the writing surface, or television stand for those who had a TV  A steel toilet/sink combination sat in the corner up by the door and a large steel locker was bolted to the floor adjacent to the concrete bed.  I rolled the mattress out, placed the sheets and blankets on it, and then sat back.  A few minutes later, a piece of thick paper attached to a string came sliding beneath my door.  I didn’t know what it was so I just sat on my bunk staring down at it until someone called out my cell number and told me to pull on the line.  I didn’t know what was going on, so I came to the door and asked who it was.  I was informed that it was my neighbor across the hall.  \tI climbed down on the floor, peeked under the door, and saw that the string was coming from his cell.  As I began pulling, I noticed a few magazines slide from beneath his door.  I pulled them in and took them off of the line.  Inside was a short note introducing himself.  He let me know that if I needed something else to read, I could just holler over at him.  His name was Lowrider, and he turned out to be a cool older guy.  He was quiet and laid back, but wasn’t to be played with.  After a couple of days, I learned that he was in the hole for slicing another inmate’s face up with a razor blade.  The other inmate owed him some money and refused to pay up when it was time, so Lowrider responded according to the laws of the environment.  This was proof that even the most mild-mannered human can be pushed into graphic violence in order to survive the rigors of prison life.  Despite this heinous act of violence, Lowrider was a cool dude. He understood the old convict code that said when someone first arrives, you do what you can to make their time a little bit easier, and that was something I could relate to.    \tWithin a couple of days, I found out that some of the guys I had been at the Reformatory with were there, and they, along with Lowrider, filled me in on the runnings of the prison.  It didn’t take long for me to get into a nice routine.  I had always loved to read, and Standish had a very nice library, so I started sending over there for books whenever I could.   I discovered how creative Stephen King really was when I read his novels.  It was also at Standish that I got hipped to Terry McMillan and read Roots for the first time along with a few other classics.  Reading was my refuge, and I devoured everything I could get my hands on.   \tI was disappointed that I couldn’t get as many books authored by Black writers as I would have liked, but it didn’t deter me from sending requests to the library every week.  Whenever it was time for them to drop off our library books, I got excited like a kid waiting on Santa Claus to come sliding down the chimney.   In addition to books from the library, I also read every magazine that someone was willing to slide under my door.  I quickly learned to make a fish line like the one that Lowrider had slid beneath my door, and I used it to drive up and down the wing to retrieve whatever reading materials people had for me.   \tMy stay on that wing was short as I was going back and forth to the county jail on a writ regarding the case for which I was serving time in the hole.  When I returned a few months later, they moved me to a different wing, and it was then that I was introduced to a form of madness that would characterize the rest of my stay in the hole at Standish Maximum.  \tWhen I first got arrested in 1991, my father and stepmother were working at Lafayette Clinic, which was a psychiatric hospital close to downtown Detroit.  While I was in the county jail, my father was on the local news speaking out against the budget cuts, which caused the State to close a lot of its mental institutions.  This trend continued throughout the nineties, and it wasn’t until a few years into my incarceration that I was able to make the connection between what I witnessed in prison, generally speaking, and what I witnessed in the hole.  Instead of keeping the psychiatric hospitals open throughout the state, they closed them down and herded all of the patients into various state prisons, with most landing in maximum security.  Because most of the patients with psychiatric needs are hard to manage in general population, they end up being housed in the hole, where the hostile environment exacerbates their psychiatric problems.  In addition to the hostile treatment that they receive from the officers, those with mental health issues also have to face hostility from other inmates who don’t understand psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder and the like.    When I returned to Standish from the county jail, I didn’t understand what was going on, like many of the inmates.  My first day back on the cellblock, they moved an inmate named Reed across the hall from me.  As they were putting him in the cell, he and the officers had a heated exchange.  I jumped down on my floor and peeked beneath the door to see what was going on as they forced him into his cell.  Once inside, I heard them giving him an order to turn around so that they could remove the mask from his face.  I stood back up, listening and peeking out of the crack of my door, trying to hear what the officers were talking about as they left.  I noticed them carrying a black mesh mask that looked like something out of a fetish magazine.  I would later learn that they placed these masks on inmates who were considered spitters or biters.   \tWhen lunchtime came, the officers returned to Reed’s cell and asked him if he wanted his food loaf.  He swiftly told them to get the hell away from his door because he’d rather starve to death than eat food loaf.  As I sat there listening, I looked down at the small rations on my tray, and despite how hungry I was, I knew that I couldn’t eat my rations without offering to share them with the brother.  I liked the fact that he wasn’t willing to bow down and accept inferior treatment.  \t \tI slid my “car” over to Reed with a small note attached asking him if he wanted half of my food.  He wrote back, indicating that yes, he wanted some of my food.  I took half of my food and placed it in a few envelopes, attached it to the line, and slid it across to him.  He pulled it in quickly to avoid being detected by the officers.  For the next two weeks, I shared every meal with Reed until he finally got off of food loaf.  I was happy to see him get off of meal restriction because that meant I could go back to my full rations, and he could go back to his. When they passed out trays, and Reed got his, he called me to the door.  Sometimes on first shift, when one of the cool officers was working, they would leave our window shutters open until they picked up trays, or until they got ready to change shifts, so I stepped up to the window.  This was the first time they had left Reed’s window open, so I had a chance to see him face-to-face for the first time.  He was a tall, corpulent brother with a full beard that made him look like a brown-skinned version of the Ayatollah Khomeini.   “What’s going on, Reed?” I asked as I approached the door.  “You know what?” he began.  “Naw, what?” I asked.  “Man, you a bitch ass dick sucker.  Now get your hoe ass on your bunk and lay down,” he said as he broke up into a maniacal laughter.    \tI stood there with my mouth agape for a few minutes as my temper burnt red-hot.  That was the first time I had been blatantly disrespected since I entering prison, and I was completely thrown off.  Add to this the fact that I had shared half of my meal with this man for two weeks, not only starving myself, but also risking being placed on food loaf along with him.  Of course, I was pissed, and I knew the first chance I got once I was released from the hole, I was going to stab Reed in his neck.  I had to, otherwise the rest of the inmates would feel like they could get away with disrespecting me, and I would rather die than live without my dignity and respect.  Reed continued to hurl insult after insult at me as I sat on my bunk steaming.   \tI even had to go back and ask myself if I had done something unintentionally to make him feel slighted in any way, but I decided that wasn’t the case.  Maybe he was just taking my kindness for something other than what it was; whatever the case, I had made up my mind that I was going to take care of Reed on the first chance I got.  \t \tThe hardest part was not knowing when I would get my shot at him.  I was serving an indeterminate stint in the hole and knew that I would have to be approved by the Director of Prisons due to the assault on the staff charge.  I was well into my routine of reading and exercising when the counselor finally came to tell me that she was recommending me for release.  I knew it was going to take awhile before she had an answer, but I started preparing myself for my return to general population. I was also mentally preparing for a return trip to the hole because I was ready to go to war with Reed.  \tA few weeks later, I was released from the hole, and I patiently waited for the day that Reed would be released, but it never came.  As I would learn over the years, there were some inmates who did their entire sentence in the hole to prevent anyone from getting to them.  Any time they were scheduled for release, they would catch another misconduct so that the Security Classification Committee would have to keep them in administrative segregation longer.  Once I realized that Reed would never get out of the hole, I refocused my attention on doing my time in general population.   \tWhen I finally hit the yard again, it had been nearly a year since I had been in general population.  It felt weird walking from the segregation unit to the regular housing unit.  My steps felt unsure and it took a minute for me to adjust to walking without having shackles and handcuffs on.  Before I reached housing unit 3, one of the other units was released for chow.  I walked slowly, trying to find a familiar face in the crowd, but there were none to be found.  Most of the inmates were in their thirties and forties, which made me feel out of place.  Their faces were creased with the bitter, jagged lines of stress that came as a result of doing life in prison.  \t \tThe closer I got to the unit, the deeper the impact their faces had on my psyche.  Their faces carried the look of broken dreams, life disappointments, anger, and hopelessness.  It was like looking in the mirror of my future.  When I reached the unit, I shook off the thoughts of my broken future and focused on the moment.   I was assigned a cell and informed that our unit had already been to chow and yard, so I wouldn’t be able to leave my cell again until the following morning for breakfast.  I went into the cell, cleaned it, and made up the bed before sitting down.  I didn’t own a radio, tape player or television like the other inmates around me, so I pulled out the Bible and began reading it.  When I tired of the Bible, I picked up the Quran and read a few surahs.  I then said a prayer and sat back on my bunk listening to the chatter around me.  A few inmates stood at their doors talking to each other about what was on television, and I started feeling sad.  I felt left out and alone because I didn’t have my own television to help me escape the boredom.  Up to that point in my bit, I hadn’t received much financial support from my family or friends, and it hurt.  Televisions were about $89.00, and the thought that I didn’t have a quarter in my account nearly caused me to break down.  \t \tI began cursing everyone who said they loved me.  In my fragile mind, I felt like it was me against the world.  My anger began to boil and rage, which inspired me to start doing push-ups as a way to release some of the pain and frustration.  I don’t know how many push-ups I did for the first set; all I know is that I refused to get up until my muscles were burning and so tight that I thought they would pop.  It was as though I was forcing the mental and emotional pain out of my body through each set.  When I had exhausted my muscles and cleared my mind, I washed up and then laid back down to read until I fell into a restless sleep.   \tI was awakened the next morning by the sound of an officer calling out, “Five minutes before chow lines,” on the PA.  I hopped up, brushed my teeth, and washed my face, then waited for the doors to break for chow.  I wasn’t a big breakfast eater, but I needed to get out and see who was around me, and more importantly, if there was anybody there that I knew.   \tI waited until the last minute to exit my cell.  I wanted to be at the end of the line so that I could observe everything around me.  I finally walked out of the cell, trailing a few paces behind the crowd of men.  There were a few guys getting dressed hastily in the hallway so that they could make it to chow on time.  It was funny seeing them wipe the crust out of their eyes.  It was clear that they hadn’t brushed their teeth or washed their face.  We called that pulling a John Wayne, who often hopped on his horse, like a lot of cowboys did back in the day, without washing his face or brushing his teeth.   \tWhen I reached the chow hall, I saw someone I knew back when I lived in Highland Park.  His name was Day Day, and he was legendary in HP.  He was seated a few tables away, so I didn’t speak until later in the day when we were on the yard.  When he realized that I had just been released from the hole, he sent some commissary over to me and told me if I needed anything to let him know.  I couldn’t wait to sink my teeth into the candy bars and chips he had sent over.   Day Day also gave me the lay of the land.  He told me that there were a few Melanic brothers in the unit, and when we hit the big yard the following day, he would introduce me to them.  They were cool brothers, but they were older, and we really didn’t have much in common outside of us being in the same organization.   For the most part, the unit we were in was laid back, and for the first couple of weeks, I kept to myself most of the time.  I developed a routine quickly, which included working out and reading to pass the time.  I did push-ups in my cell every morning before I took my shower, and then sometimes throughout the day to burn off the anger.  The rest of the day I spent reading until the wee hours of the morning.  When they turned the lights out, I stood by my door reading, using the little bit of light that crept through the window.   After a couple of weeks, I started hooping with Day Day and a few other guys in the unit.  Then, one day, Day Day asked me to join the unit basketball team.  The games were always competitive and tempers ran red-hot.  Players argued with the refs, the coaches, and even other players.  There was a lot of bad sportsmanship displayed because winning meant everything to us.  We had been told we were losers our entire lives, and none of us wanted to have that confirmed in anything that we did.  What we didn’t realize is that our poor sportsmanship, which led to constant conflicts, stabbings, and even murder, was a reflection of the poor attitudes about life we had adopted.  We took losing personal, as if losing defined who we were.  In reality, these were meaningless basketball games designed to keep us distracted from our reality.  The basketball courts always remained full while the law library and regular library were always empty.  This was one of the many contradictions that existed in prison.   Like the rest of the brothers, I found myself on the basketball court constantly and in the middle of several conflicts.  The first conflict came when KO, one of my Melanic brothers, cursed out a brother name Rimmer-Bey, who was reffing the game.  He was a well-respected member of the Moorish Science Temple of America, also known as the Moabites.  KO refused to back down and the gym became very tense.  One of Rimmer-Bey’s cronies came over and acted like he was going to ride out, so I stepped up, ready to jump in the fray.  We were firm believers that you came to the aid and assistance of a worthy brother, so I wasn’t about to back down.  Later, I learned that guy who came to Rimmer-Bey’s defense was a known hitman back in Jackson.  A few of the guys marveled at how I stood up to him, adding to my credibility on the yard.   The next time we broke for yard, the tension was very thick between the Moabites and the Melanics, and I was ready to go to battle.  We came out with shanks and were sure they had done the same.  Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and our respective security personnel brought the potential war to a head before anyone was stabbed or seriously hurt.   \tWhen the basketball season concluded, I vowed not to participate in the next season because I realized that KO was a hothead, so conflicts were inevitable.  Like many of the brothers in the joint, the court was the place where he took out all of his frustration.  I had just gotten out of solitary confinement and wasn’t trying to go back over a basketball game.  \tAfter a month or so, I was transferred to another unit. I was pissed because it was nice being around someone I knew from the streets.  However, one of the realities of the joint was that we couldn’t always dictate where we ended up.   \tWhen I got to the new unit, I went straight to the counselor to get classified for a job since I had my GED already.  When she called me into the office, I just knew I was about to get a job in the kitchen.  I wanted to work in the kitchen so that I could eat extra meals and start saving up money to get my own TV and radio.  I was tired of being one of the only guys on the tier without my own appliances.  I didn’t want to bug my father about sending me money because I knew he had to take care of my younger sisters.  I also felt like I had made my bed, and I had to lie in it.  Some days, I dreamed about someone thinking enough about me to send me something out of the clear blue sky, even if it was just ten dollars and a few lines to say “I’m thinking about you.”   But it never happened.   \tThe counselor told me that she couldn’t classify me for a job yet because they considered me a security threat.  According to their policy, I had to be in the unit for at least 90 days.  I asked her how I could be considered any more of a threat than any of the other men at the prison, and she told me that I had gotten a lot of misconducts in a relatively short amount of time. I slunk back to my cell heartbroken.  I wanted to work more than anything so that I could make a few dollars and get out of my cell regularly.  As much as I loved to read, being locked in my cell for twenty-three hours was taking its toll on me.  I did everything I could to get out as much as I could, but I was very limited.  I went to the library twice a week, Melanic service once a week, and attended yard when it was our hour to be out.   \tI was fortunate to be around a few cool guys, some who were close to my age.  They knew that I didn’t have a television so they would sneak me their radios and tape players whenever they could.  I also had a few solid brothers in the unit who liked to read, and they sent me as many books as my mind could handle.  They fed me books by J.A Rogers, Ivan Van Sertima, Marcus Garvey, and Dr. Chancellor Williams.  With each book that they fed me, I felt a part of my soul growing and opening up to commune with my ancestors.  I immersed myself in African history and imagined what it was like in ancient Kemet (KMT), which had been renamed Egypt by the Greeks. I thought about the powerful pyramids, which have stood the test of time, and wondered how they had been engineered.  I thought about Mali and Timbuktu and the vast knowledge that was the envy of the world.  In the short time I was at Standish, I learned more about African history than I had ever learned during all of my years in school.  As each day passed, I felt myself growing wiser and stronger.  \tOne day I hit the yard, and there was a lot of buzz amongst the brothers.  They were excited because a brother named Baruti was being moved into our unit.  Baruti was a brother who was held in high-esteem by the other brothers because of his personal self-discipline and integrity.  I didn’t know much about the brother other than what I had heard about him catching a case in Jackson.  They said he had been convicted of open murder for the death of another inmate.  From what the brothers told me, Baruti had been charged based on some flimsy evidence and the weak testimony of another inmate.  I took this information with a grain of salt because I had learned enough over the years to know that information passed around the cellblock wasn’t reliable.   \tWhen I finally met Baruti, I was impressed with his calm, quiet demeanor.  He wasn’t boastful about his jail exploits as were some of the other guys from Jackson who felt like they always had something to prove.  Instead, he was a wise teacher who taught mostly through his actions.  Every morning when we hit the yard, he exercised, and then ran vigorously, outpacing and outdistancing everyone on the yard.  On the days we held study group, he always gave me encouraging words.  He told me never to take anything at face value and be diligent in my research.  When I made valid points when building with the brothers, he would give me a nod of encouragement to continue.  \tAfter a few weeks, he took a liking to me like an uncle or older brother.  We worked out together at the pull-up bars along with a brother named Tim Greer-Bey.  When I first started doing pull-ups, they laughed because I could only do one or two despite the fact that I had an athletic build and could do push-ups all day.  Even though they laughed, they told me to never give up, and within a couple of weeks, I went from doing one and two reps a set to doing ten to fifteen.  By the time I was paroled, I was one of the best who ever touched the pull-up bars.   I continued to build with my elders and absorb as much wisdom as I could.  It is because of their wise counsel that I was able to leave prison with a sense of purpose.  I didn’t always listen to them in the moment, but over the years, I found all that they shared with me to be of great value. \tI recall one day coming out to the yard and a few of the brothers informed me that we were having a security meeting.  It turned out that a guy in another cellblock had gotten into an altercation with one of our Melanic brothers and had kicked his store goods all over the yard.  We were incensed because none of the other brothers had stepped up to do anything.  The way prison worked, an attack against one of us, was an attack against all of us.  The incident wasn’t something that we could overlook as an isolated occurrence because it would reflect poorly on us as an organization, but moreso as men who claimed to be brothers.   \tDuring our security meeting, we were briefed on what occurred and who was responsible.  It just so happened that the inmate who was responsible for the attack on our brother was working on the yard crew during our yard time.  The tension in the air was so thick because everyone knew that we would retaliate.  The hard part was trying to figure out when and how we would respond so that we went undetected by the officers and the security camera.   When it was time to decide who would go on the mission, it came down to me and another brother who was a few years older than me.  The rest of the brothers backed out and came up with all kinds of excuses.  When our head of security asked me if I wanted to help set the play up, I agreed without hesitation.  I was tired of hearing the excuses and was tired of the other organizations looking at us, waiting to see if we would do anything about the incident.  When I agreed to help retaliate, the other brother said he would ride with me on the play.  We strategized with the rest of our security to set the play in motion the following day while during yard.  We had to figure out a way to lure the offender to an area where we wouldn’t be visible to the cameras, and then we had to get rid of the shank after we put our strategy in motion.   When we settled on how we would handle things, I went back to my regular routine of working out and talking to Tim and Baruti.  I didn’t discuss what was shared at our security meeting, but I suspected they knew what was going on.  As a member of security, we were not allowed to discuss information that we shared in our meetings with anyone.  We continued working out, and Baruti gave me some information that would take a few years for me to appreciate.  He told me to never allow anyone to use me, including my comrades.  At the time, I didn’t fully understand why he shared such wisdom with me, but over the years, it all made sense.  In me, he could see my loyalty to the cause and the brothers, but he also saw the naiveté that was common amongst young, impressionable brothers.  We held a romanticized view of the movement and our loyalty was often misguided.  We were always eager to prove our loyalty to our organization, and the older, wiser members often took advantage of this.   \tThe following day, it was time to set the play in motion.  I had nervous energy coursing through my body from the moment I woke up until it was time to put in work.  It hadn’t been that long since my release from the hole, and I had no desire to go back, but my sense of loyalty and desire to see our name defended overshadowed whatever thoughts I had of a return trip to the hole.  When the yard opened up, I felt like all eyes were on us, even though most of the population didn’t have a clue about what we were up to.  In reality, I felt a combination of guilt and desire because I wanted everyone on the yard to know what were about to do so that our respect could be restored.   I could feel my hands sweating as I walked across the yard to meet at our regular meeting spot. When I approached, I greeted the brothers and they returned our unique greeting, which was one of the many things we shared that connected us and increased our bond.  After a quick briefing, the brother who was responsible for bringing the shank out produced the crude, prison-made knife.  The rusty piece of steel with a handle made of torn bedsheets looked menacing as he passed it to me.  The other brother who agreed to ride with me produced a shank as well.  We went over the plan again before leaving the meeting post.    \tWe walked a few laps around the track, patiently waiting for our prey to reach the location where we knew the cameras wouldn’t be able to see us.  As many cameras and gun towers that the prisons had, there were always blind spots at every prison.  These spots were known by every inmate and considered death traps.  It didn’t take long before our target began moving in the direction we desired.  He was a yard crew worker and we knew it wouldn’t be long before he’d be right where we wanted him.  As he approached the camera’s blindspot, we quickened our pace.  Before he realized what was happening, it was too late.  When the shank first pierced his skin, he hollered out, “What I do?”  He was stabbed a few more times before he took off running across the yard.  We slowly walked toward the far end of the track as the other securities came and retrieved the shanks.  Once they had secured the weapons, we took off jogging on the track, blending in with the rest of the joggers.  When we reached the pull-up bars, we watched as the officer’s administered first aid until a few nurses came out and escorted him to health services.  Within minutes, the siren sounded and they ordered everyone to go back to their units.  \tI just knew at any moment the officers would be coming to cuff me and take me to the hole, but they never came.  The following day, the yard was abuzz over the stabbing, and our reputation was restored.  This was the law of the jungle.  Not responding would have left our members vulnerable to attacks by other inmates and put our stores, and other means by which we made money, at stake.  This part of prison life was something that always brought me internal conflict.  On one hand, I learning about our history and culture and reading about how much we needed to love and care for our brothers; but on the other hand, whenever a brother did something that we felt violated our code of honor, we dealt with it by stabbing him or busting him in the head.  It wouldn’t be long before those contradictions challenged me to make some tough decisions about the Melanics and my role in the organization.   \tThe rest of my stay at Standish was uneventful, and it wasn’t long before it I was being transferred back to MR. It was especially hard saying goodbye to some of the older brothers because we never knew if we would see each other again.  They had given me so much wisdom and encouraged me every step of the way to fill my mind with as much knowledge as I could.  I will never forget how the older brothers in the library embraced me when they saw that I came consistently to check out books.  It had gotten to the point where they had books already picked out for me when I showed up.  Whenever a new title arrived by a Black author, they would hold it for me.  When I read it, they wanted a review to see if it was worth them reading, but more importantly, to make sure that I was reading the books.  I was going to miss my older comrades, but I was ready to get back around guys my age and decrease my security level.   \tWhen I went inside to speak with the counselor, he told me that it would be about two weeks before I’d be transferred.  I wanted to get transferred to Ryan Correctional Facility, which was in Detroit, but the waiting list was long.  He explained to me that it would be at least a year or so before I got transferred if I chose to go to Ryan.  I didn’t want to run the risk of getting caught up if I stayed any longer, so I told the counselor to send me somewhere that didn’t have a waiting list.  He told me that I could go back to the Reformatory if I wanted to, so I chose to return to Gladiator School.  When I told the brothers about my choice, they thought I was crazy; however, looking back, I know it was divine order.  There were things I needed to learn about life that I wouldn’t have gotten anywhere else. \tI told Baruti that I was getting transferred back to MR and his eyes lit up with excitement.  He told me that his son was there and asked that I connect with him when I got there.  Over the next couple of weeks, he reminded me of a few things he had shared with me, and then it was time for me to depart.  Little did I know, Baruti and I would be forever connected even though it would be nearly 16 years before we saw each other again.   Chapter 15 \t“Man, it’s a hundred niggas outside our door right now,” one of our roommates cried out in a panicked voice. I looked over at Maceo and AD, who I had met earlier that day on the Greyhound bus headed to Job Corps.  Out of the ten brothers who caught the bus down to Kentucky with us, Maceo and AD were the two that I related to the most. We connected immediately and made a pact to stick together and support each other while we were at Job Corps.  It didn’t take long for our pact to be put to the test.   \tUpon our arrival, we were orientated and assigned to a temporary room along with the rest of the guys that we traveled with.  Once we got done with our orientation, we went to check out the surroundings.  That’s when we met a guy named June from Chicago.  He told us that he did store runs for the guys in the unit and was available to do a beer run if we wanted him to.  It had been a long day and we all wanted to catch a buzz before we went to bed, so we got our money together and gave June enough to get two cases of beer.  When he returned, he told us that he had to drop one of the cases because the campus police was chasing him.  When he gave us the other case of beer, we looked at each other to be sure we were all picking up on the nickel-slick bullshit that was seeping out of his pores.  I hadn’t long left the block dealing with desperate drug addicts who tried every trick in the game to get over.  The fact that we had paid him and offered to drink with him increased my anger.  \t“Dig nigga, you have a few options, and I’m only going to tell you this once. You can either produce the other case of beer you trying to play on, produce the money, or get your ass beat,” I said calmly as I approached him.  \t“Man, I’m telling you they knocked me,” June said nervously.   In addition to trying to be slick, June was a coward, and that really pissed me off.  I couldn’t stand for someone to think they were about to get over on me, and I wasn’t good at holding my feelings in.  Before he could continue explaining, I punched June in the face, causing him to stagger backwards as he grabbed his face.  He started hollering like a little girl and then took off running.  Maceo and AD burst out laughing as we went back into our room.  We didn’t know the dynamics of local gang culture, city cliques or other affiliations that existed at the center, so we never anticipated him getting nearly half of the unit to help him retaliate.   \tWhen our roommate walked out and discovered a sea of guys standing outside of our door ready to go to war, we knew it was about to get real.  Maceo and AD looked at me like let’s go out and see what’s up.  When we opened the door, June was standing in the middle of a group of guys holding his face and talking all animated about what happened.  A stocky guy from Chicago stepped up holding a lock in his hand and asked who hit June in the face.  I stepped up and told him that I had hit him and was going to beat his ass until he paid my money.  My reaction caused a few of the other guys to start talking shit like they wanted to do something.  I stepped further into the hallway and told them to come on with it as Maceo and AD followed closely behind.   \tThough we were outnumbered, we stood our ground, which through them off of their game.  They hadn’t anticipated we would be ready to fight although the odds were in their favor.   I had a philosophy about fighting.  Once a person got in armsreach of me, I was swinging first.  As we inched out into the hallway, they backed up, and it was then that I knew most of them were bluffing.  They had a lot to lose for fighting on campus, and we felt like we had nothing to lose because we didn’t want to be there in the first place.  Before the tension exploded into an all-out brawl, a guy named Tracey from New York stepped up and suggested we go one-on-one.  He was older than most of us, and I later found out that he was the oldest brother on the campus.  I could tell that they respected Tracey because they grew silent when he spoke. \t“Y’all know June be trying to be slick every time somebody new arrive, and dude and them ain’t buying it, so let that nigga go one-on-one if he ain’t going to give up the money,” Tracey said. \tThey turned and looked at June, and his facial expression made it clear that he didn’t want to fight.  His fellas looked at him like, “What are you going to do?”  Before he could decide, I decided for him.  I ran up on him and started swinging.  He slipped the first punch, but wasn’t swift enough to slip the next two.  He fell, and as he tried to scramble to his feet, I kicked him in his ass and he took off running.  Tracey started laughing, which caused the rest of the guys standing out in the hallway to laugh as well.  It turned out that they didn’t really care for June, but felt like they had to step up and confront us because we were new.  When it was all said and done, they invited us outside to drink with them.  What they didn’t realize was that we had just initiated the first move of a hostile takeover, Detroit-style.   When we were done drinking, me, Maceo and AD went back to the room and clowned our scary ass roommate who was also from Detroit.  We joked with him about how scared he sounded when he realized how many guys were out in the hallway waiting on us.  He took it in stride and told us that he wasn’t the fighting type.  We had to respect him for being honest.   \tOnce we were done joking, I laid on my bunk and replayed the day in my head.  When the bus departed from Detroit, we had no idea what to expect in Kentucky.  There were five of us leaving from Detroit, and at our first stopover in Cleveland, we picked up about twelve guys from Chicago and Milwaukee.  Most of the trip, we sat in the back listening to rap by Detroit’s Most Wanted, Esham, and Awesome Dre.  We were missing home already and music by our local rappers offered us the kind of comfort we needed.  Before we reached Kentucky, we connected with a couple of the guys from Milwaukee who were interested in our music.  We kicked it and smoked weed together when we got off at the last rest stop.  \tWhen we finally reached Kentucky, it was early in the evening and a van from the Job Corps Center awaited us.  The driver, who was also a counselor at the center, was a cool chubby brother who spoke with a country twang.  He told us that he was going to take us to get something to eat before we got to the campus because the kitchen would be closed by the time we arrived.  When we were all aboard, he took off speeding.  It was cool until he started flying through the mountain range.  I had a window seat, and every time he hit a curve, I wanted to close my eyes, but my mind wouldn’t let me.  It was by far the scariest fifteen-minute ride of my life, and from the looks on the other brothers’ faces, it was theirs as well.  \tOur counselor pulled into the parking lot of a Wendy’s and hopped out of the driver’s seat.  He came around and opened the door and before we could hop out, he started giving us a lecture about the race dynamics down there.  He told us not to stare or gawk at the White women because their men would get mad.  We all started laughing, but the serious expression on his face told us it was not a laughing matter.  He continued to explain to us how we would be treated by White people while there. He said that they wouldn’t speak to us or interact with us, and it was best for us to always travel in groups.  As he talked, images of “Whites Only” signs danced through my head.  I thought about the things I had learned in school about racial harmony and Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream.  I also thought about how my parents had raised me to view all people as people.  The neighborhood we grew up in was primarily White, so I believed my parents with all my heart.  Unfortunately, they didn’t warn me or inform me that bigotry still existed in some parts of the country.   \tWhen our counselor was done talking, we got out of the van and headed inside Wendy’s.  We all joked about his mini-lecture in our effort to lighten the mood.  None of us really took it that serious, and most of us thought he was trying to scare us to keep us from running wild.  But we were all in for a major shock once we entered the restaurant.  The moment we stepped inside, the restaurant grew eerily quiet.  Every White person inside, including the staff, stopped doing what they were doing and looked at us like we were crazy.  We looked around at each other in confusion. The emotional weight of America’s racial history came crashing through the building.  I could see the look of dismay on the brothers’ faces as we all struggled to figure out what that moment meant to us.  I felt violated by their stares of disgust, and started to feel deep-seeded anger slowly bubble to the surface.  I was pissed off by the sheer arrogance and audacity of people who looked like backwoods hillbillies to think of themselves as superior. \t“Man, fuck these White motherfuckers,” I said to the brother standing next to me. \t“Yeah man, fuck them.  We ain’t got to eat in this bitch.  You can take my Black ass home,” another brother chimed in.   \tOur voices punched a hole in the silence as the White customers started grabbing their food and storming out of the restaurant.  Our counselor urged us to quiet down, but it was too late, we became more boisterous.  Before long, we were making a mockery of their ignorance and his fear.  Like other Blacks from his generation, our counselor had grown up in an environment where Black people were forced to be silent on race matters.  We were from the ‘hood, however, and if you violated someone, you were getting your ass kicked no matter what color you were. Instead of storming out like we started to, we decided to stay and eat.  In our small way, we were saying, “Our ancestors were forced to go through the back door, but we’re barging our way through the front.”   \tA few of the staff offered up fake smiles and weak apologies, but we weren’t having it.  We began mocking them, ordering our food with exaggerated, buffoonish language.  “Issa like to order me sa burga sir,” someone said as we laughed and enjoyed our food.  It wasn’t long before our counselor was laughing along with us, though it was a nervous laughter.  Although he seemed cool, we had lost whatever respect we had for him.  When we were done eating, he drove us through the mountains to the Job Corps Center.   \tThe campus sat on spacious land surrounded by mountains and forests.  When we pulled up, there were small groups of guys sprinkled across the parking lot and basketball court talking amongst themselves.  I took in the scenery as I smoked a cigarette and waited on the rest of the guys to get their bags.  When we all had our bags, we went inside the building and headed to a large room where they gave us the rundown on what rooms we would be sharing and what trades they offered.  They told us the center’s rules when it came to gambling, hanging out, and going AWOL, and then explained the misconduct system that they had in place, which restricted our privileges when we violated the rules.  After explaining the rules, the staff went through our luggage to make sure we hadn’t smuggled any weapons or drugs.  A few of us had brought weed, but it appeared everyone had either smoked all of theirs or had it concealed in their underwear.   \tWhen we were done with orientation, we headed to our rooms. Once we resolved the issue with June running off with our case of beer, we settled into day-to-day life on the campus.  Over the first few days, we checked out every trade they had available.  I decided to try out carpentry because it was the only trade that piqued my interest.  I felt like I could be creative as a carpenter moreso than a plumber or electrician.   Within a week, we were assigned to our permanent room.  Maceo, AD, myself and a brother from Milwaukee named Mark moved down to dorm three into the same room, which was already occupied by a brother named Peanut from Detroit and a brother named Spook from Flint.  We each had our own bunk and a wall locker to keep our belongings.  Peanut and Spook gave us the rundown and told us that dorm three was considered the troublemakers’ dorm.  When we stepped into the hallway, we could tell the difference between that dorm and the one we had just left.  Music was playing loud and guys were hanging out in the halls shooting dice and talking shit.  It was right up our alley, and we made ourselves at home.   \tWithin a few weeks, Maceo and I were running a black market store, selling everything from single cigarettes to liquor that we had smuggled in. It was our way of supplementing the nominal income that we earned from Job Corps and whatever we received from home.  We took our illegally earned profits and bought clothing, alcohol for our own enjoyment, and whatever else we felt we needed to make ourselves feel comfortable.   \tDespite our illegal activity, we were both optimistic that we would be able to make it through Job Corps.  I enrolled in the carpentry program and started off going to GED class every other day.  I hated GED class because the work made me feel like I was in middle school.  It wasn’t challenging, and felt like I was repeating things I had learned at the age of twelve. When the teacher noticed that I wasn’t doing my work, he asked me what was going on.  I told him that the work was too easy, and he laughed in my face.  He said he had heard that line from a few others who lacked ambition and drive to get their GED.  I laughed back in his face and told him I was serious, so he decided to challenge me.  He told me if I could pass one of his tests, he would let me take the half-test to prepare for the GED.  However, if I failed, I would have to do all of the work he gave me.  I took him up on his offer. \tThe teacher gave me the test, and ten minutes later, I returned to his desk with my test completed.  He looked at me suspiciously and asked if I had just randomly written down the answers.  I told him that I had learned how to speed-read when I was 8 years old and was done with the test.  He had a cynical look on his face until he started grading the test, which I had aced.  True to his word, he gave me the half-test, and when I aced that, he put me on the list to take my GED.  He later explained that no other student in his class had been able to do that.   A few weeks later, I was on a bus headed to Kentucky State to take the GED test.  A few of the guys who were testing for the second or third time bet me that I wouldn’t pass the first time.  I told them that I would gladly take their money, and I did.  I breezed through the test, and had time to spare after each segment, so I hung out on the campus of Kentucky State in between test segments.  Sadly, I didn’t realize at the time that I was on the campus of a Historically Black University; all I knew was that I wanted to get my GED knocked out so that I could enroll at the university and chase girls.   \tWhile we waited on our test results, I was allowed to go to my carpentry class everyday.  Things were moving along smoothly until the cumulative effects of overt racism overwhelmed my young, rebellious spirit.  After the Wendy’s incident, we had a stretch where we didn’t have any problems, and then there was like an explosion.  It started when one of the staff members discovered that I had a Public Enemy tape in my possession.  I was called into the director’s office and told that I was not allowed to play or possess their tape because their music was found to be inciteful and antagonistic toward the White staff members.  I found his explanation laughable and told him that I would play whatever music I chose, which led him to write me an insubordination report. I loss the privilege to leave the campus, but I didn’t care.  Before long, I had another tape smuggled in.  \tA few weeks later, some racist White guy shot our roommate Peanut in the arm while he was out on pass in Charleston, West Virginia.  Charleston was the town we hung out in when we had weekend passes.  Peanut and a young lady were waiting on a cab when a car load of White guys drove by and told them to get their “nigger asses” out of town.  Moments later, they returned and started shooting, hitting Peanut in the arm.   When the report of what happened reached us, we were livid.  The campus was ready to explode.  One of the Black supervisors called an emergency meeting with us at one o’clock in the morning.  He urged us to be calm and told us that he hoped the incident wouldn’t make us angry with the majority White staff or other White people we encountered in Prestonburg.  He was an apologist, and whenever we brought racial incidents to his attention, he made every excuse in the book for White people, and we had had enough.  He was the typical charismatic kneegrow that White people send into the community to “calm the natives.”   \tDespite our anger, we allowed his words to soothe us and lull us to sleep. A week or so later, we were evacuated from the building when a bomb threat was called in.  Someone had threatened to blow up the building if our “city nigger asses” didn’t leave town.  It was nearly three o’clock in the morning when we were evacuated from our dorm, and we had to stand outside in the cold for what seemed like an eternity while we waited on the bomb squad to clear the building.  As we stood waiting, we watched a cross burning in the woods across from the center.   My blood was boiling, and I was ready to fight back.  I refuse to live in fear, but honestly, I was concerned that the nameless, faceless cowards who made the threat would one day make true on their threat to blow the building up.  When the building was cleared, the staff held another meeting.  We listened, but we all looked at each and silently agreed that it was time for us to hold our own meetings. \tWe talked amongst each other and agreed that we would retaliate the next time one of us was hurt or threatened.  We knew that we would not lie down and accept such racist mistreatment if we were back in Detroit, Chicago, New York or LA, so we damn sure weren’t going to accept it there.   It wasn’t long before we were put to the test.  The staff always took us on outings, and one night we were given an opportunity to go to a basketball game at one of the local high schools in Plainseville, Kentucky.  We boarded the bus intending to enjoy a night out and what we hoped would be a good game. When we entered the gym, a silence came over the crowd as we walked to our seats.  We could hear the whispers blazing through the crowd like a wildfire.  They didn’t want our kind there.   We felt judged and deemed unworthy of sharing a human experience based on our skin color, and that cut us deeply.  Our coach, who was also my carpentry teacher, calmed us down and told us to just sit back and enjoy the game.  For nearly two hours, we sat there in the midst of our simmering anger and their vile, racist attitudes.   \tWhen the game ended, we filed out of the gym and were about to board the bus when Derrick, who was from Chicago, asked if anyone had seen his homeboy named Inches.  Inches had earned the nickname due to his small stature; however, what he lacked in height, he made up for in heart.  We all looked around and before anyone could search the bus, Inches came running around the corner holding his eye.  Hot on his heels were three red-faced White men hollering and cursing about “niggers” looking at their women.   \tThe blood drained from our coach’s face when he realized we had reached our limit with the violent, racist attacks.  Derrick asked Inches what happened, and before Inches could say anything, a White man came forward and shouted, “That little nigger blew a kiss at my wife.”  The boldness of his words sliced through our hearts with a coldness that made Chicago winters appear mild, but instead of shrinking from his words, we responded swiftly, audaciously and fearlessly.  We were outnumbered 2 to 1, but we were infused with an anger that increased our strength tenfold.  Derrick delivered the first blow, knocking the White man down with one punch.  Before he could recover, several guys from Chicago leapt on the guy, kicking and punching him ruthlessly.  \tThe two men who were with the White guy had a look of terror in their eyes when they realized we weren’t the meek, humble Negroes they had anticipated. We sensed the fear in there eyes, and like lions, we pounced on our prey.  The crowd screamed as we beat and kicked them beneath the bus.  When my foot met the soft underbelly of the racist idiot who had shot Peanut, I felt like I was delivering a blow for Peanut and all the other brothers who had been victimized while they were in Kentucky trying to improve their chances at life.  We continued to beat the three men, and a few other people in the crowd, until we heard the sound of police sirens.   \tWe all ran to the bus when we heard the sirens. Our coach jumped onto the bus, pulled off immediately, and raced us back to Job Corps.  Plump beads of sweat slithered down his forehead and his lips trembled as he gripped the steering wheel so tight that the veins in his hands looked like they were going to pop.  Once he drove out of the parking lot, we began cheering wildly as we recounted the blows that we delivered and the impact of each blow on our intended targets.  None of us knew what to expect when we returned to the center; all we knew was that we were going to celebrate our victory.   \tWhen we got back to the center, an emergency staff meeting was called.  The coach told the rest of the staff that he didn’t see who did what.  He explained that Inches had been attacked first, and someone from the school corroborated his story.  The only thing they could do at that point was ban us from school.   Though we were victorious that night, the racial tensions continued.  A few weeks later, I was in the chow hall talking to one of my guys when the security guard came and told me to sit down.  I told him that I would sit down as soon as I finished conducting my business.  He looked me dead in my face and said, “Boy, when I say sit, you sit.” His words scraped my spirit like fingernails on a chalkboard.   “What the fuck you just say to me?” I replied angrily.  “I said, boy, you sit down when I say,” he responded with a smirk.   Those were the last words he spoke before I slung my tray at his head.  He stumbled back and radioed for help as everyone in the chow hall started cheering and laughing.   \tFollowing that incident, I was called into the director’s office and told that I was being terminated from the program.  He informed me that I had passed my GED, but my termination meant that I wouldn’t be able to attend Kentucky State.  I stood up and called him a racist-loving asshole as another officer escorted me out of his office.  \tI returned to my room and packed my belongings.  When word reached Maceo, he rushed back to the room to find out what happened.  Before I could tell him what went down, he shot out of the room. Moments later, he came back and started packing.  He had gone to talk to the director and told him that he was leaving because he didn’t want to be around that level of racism.   \tWhen we were packed, they put us on the first bus smoking out of Kentucky headed back to the D.  As we rode the bus home, I thought about the mentality of the brothers that I was leaving behind.  I wondered what it was about them that allowed them to be complacent in the face of such blatant racism.  I thought about how I could have handled things differently, but none of the options felt good.  It wasn’t in me to go along to get along.   When we touched down in Detroit, I prepared myself for the lecture I knew I would receive from my father.  I knew he was going to be disappointed, but I had to follow my heart.   \tOnce I returned from Job Corps, I lived with my father for a little while, but it just wasn’t working out.  He had tried his best to get me on the right path, but there was another path that held me captivated.  Unfortunately, it was a cracked and distorted path that led to self-destruction. Chapter 16 \t They say the third time’s the charm, and in my case, it proved to be true when I returned to the Michigan Reformatory in the fall of 1992.  Reflecting back, I realize that my third stint at the Reformatory was the most important leg of my journey through the belly of the beast. In the midst of daily stabbings, human despair, and overt racism, the man Shaka was born and the boy Jay was laid to rest.  It was at this point that I started understanding things about myself that my father had been telling me from the time I was a child.  I finally acknowledged my own intelligence and accepted the fact that I possessed leadership qualities, which I could use for good or bad.  But more importantly, I laid the foundation for my transformation and began understanding the power of empathy and human compassion My transformation didn’t happen overnight, however.  As with anything worthwhile in life, I found myself working hard to overcome the violent legacy of my past.  I waged a war with myself, dug my heels in, and fought until the end to heal my broken soul.  \tMy first two weeks back at the Reformatory was an adjustment period for me.  I knew I would be there for awhile and had to figure out how to make the best of my time.  I had encountered several of my homeboys from my old neighborhood on the yard and in the chow hall.  Tommie Seymore, who had lived around the corner from my old house on Camden, was working in the chow hall.  He told me to get classified for the kitchen so that I could be assigned to J-Block where he locked.  I also ran into my homeboy Boise who told me to try and get in the factory, but I couldn’t because I had a dangerous contraband misconduct in my file.  After deep consideration, I decided to get classified for the kitchen.   \tTwo weeks after I got classified, I was told to pack up and move my belongings over to J-Block.  I was assigned a cell in the middle of the tier and given a job working on the chow line in the kitchen.  The culture of the kitchen was unlike anything I had experienced in prison.  It was a world unto itself, where you never knew what each day would bring.  Stabbings over unpaid debts was the norm, and the kitchen was always tense on the days that we received our tokens.  We were all security conscious and had shanks stashed throughout the kitchen.  This was the reality of life in a prison filled with young, violent offenders.  In the midst of the chaos, we were able to carve out a sacred space to study and discuss Black history, religion and revolutionary theory.   \tWhen I returned to the Reformatory, a few brothers told me that there was a Melanic brother that I had to meet.  They said that he was as avid a reader as I was and was very serious about transforming himself and others.  I was excited to meet another young lion who had the same kind of fire that I had.  They told me his name was Yusef and he locked in J-Block, so when I moved over there, I sought the brother out.  After a couple of short conversations, we discovered that I knew his father Baruti, who I had just left at Standish Max.   As usual, there was a tense feeling out process for both of us.  We were veterans of the streets and trust was something that didn’t come easy; it was earned in the trenches.  Although I knew his father briefly, I had to get to know Yusef on my own. As I had learned from past experiences, family lineage didn’t guarantee a solid pedigree.   \tOver the next few weeks, we began building a bond based on our love of reading and our desire to make a difference in the world.  At that time, neither of us knew whether we would ever get out of prison alive, but we prepared as if we would be released the next day.  Each time we exchanged a book, we would gather at one of the tables in the chow hall or on the yard and dissect what we had read.  This was an important part of our re-building process.  We wanted to ensure that we both came away with a comprehensive understanding of what we read.  This was also our way of challenging each other to grow and separating the sincere brothers from those who lacked sincerity.   \tYusef and I had a lot in common; we were both young fathers and had come from some of the most depressed neighborhoods in Detroit.  However, our stories weren’t unique.  We were surrounded by nearly fifteen hundred young men who had similar stories filled with poverty, desperation, and hopelessness.  Indeed, this was a common thread that ran through prison, tying us all together.  Most of us came from backgrounds where high-levels of gun violence were the norm in addition to child and sexual abuse.  We were the broken souls that dwelled inner-city streets, hopeless and desperate for an escape from our hellish existence.   \tI continued to build with several solid Melanic brothers like Simba and my dude Smiley Senghor, who I had met while in quarantine a few years earlier.  I also had deep discussions with brothers from other organizations because I felt that it was important to understand all of our people.  We all held different philosophical and theological views, yet we were all being oppressed by the same beast.  With this realization at the forefront of my mind, I sought to find common ground for us to build on.  This was one of the most important discoveries that I made during that time.  Because of my willingness to learn and understand the teachings of others, I was able to build solid allegiances and bring an end to some of the violence that was standard between groups.  However, there was no way to stop all of the bloodshed.   \tI tried to settle down into a groove while doing my time, but I could never get comfortable with the idea of remaining in prison for most of my young life.  Mentally, I rebelled, and it manifested in my actions toward the staff and other inmates.  Everyday, I was consumed with anger despite how much I built with the brothers.  I thought about my son and family constantly, and it tore my heart to shreds.  The thought of my son growing up without my love and guidance tore patches out of my heart.  I looked at his pictures daily and prayed that one day I’d be able to see him and hold him in my arms like I imagined my father held me when I was a baby.  I thought about teaching him how to walk and ride his first bike, and how to defend himself in a fight.  But I knew I wouldn’t be able to do any of those things.  I was comforted, however, by the fact that I knew my father would ensure my son’s basic needs were met.   \tOne day when I was returning from my work detail, an officer called out over the PA to let me know that I had a visit.  It had been a while since I’d seen my father, and I was very excited to see him and talk to him about some of the changes I was making in my life.  As I got ready for my visit, I didn’t know what to expect because I had never had a visit at the Michigan Reformatory.  I showered and rushed back to my cell to dress in some clothes I had borrowed from one of the brothers.  I didn’t have my own clothes yet and didn’t want to go out on a visit in my state blues.  Once I was dressed, I headed up to the control center to be processed through for my visit.   \tWhen I entered the visiting room, I was directed upstairs where my father and two younger sisters were sitting with my son Jay.  My heart began pounding like an African drum as I studied my son from head to toe.  His little fat cheeks just melted all of the prison hardness away like butter on hot toast.  I greeted my father and sisters with a hug and smile before attempting to pick up my son.  He pulled away from me, and in that moment, I wanted to die on the spot.  It took all of the energy I had inside to hold back the tears that threatened to overflow like a swollen river.  Before any depressing thoughts were able to take root, my father intervened with words of wisdom.   \t“It’s okay. He’ll come to you. It just takes him a little bit of time to warm up to people,” he reassured me.   I listened to my father’s words calmly, but inside I was screaming, “I’m not people, I’m his father!”  I remained silent, however, and took a seat with my family.  We had small talk about what was going on back home, but the entire time, my mind was on thinking of a way to break out of prison that day so that I could be with my family.  I continued to interact with Lil’ Jay as we called him throughout the visit, and finally after a half an hour or so, he allowed me to pick him up.  I held him close to me so that he could feel my heartbeat and the undeniable love that I had for him.  He smiled and laughed, and for the short time that I held him, he erased the prison walls that held me captive.  I could see my features and Brenda’s features in him. He was a beautiful baby, and I wanted nothing more than to protect him from the cruel, ugly world that he was born into.   After about an hour and a half, Jay started to fuss and get a bit cranky.  My father said that he was probably ready for a nap, so they were going to leave. I hugged Jay tightly before handing him over to my father.  I then notified the officers that my family was ready to go.  \tWe were escorted downstairs and I stood silently as my family left the visiting room.  A few minutes later, an officer came to get me so that I could return to my cell.  When I exited the visiting room, my father called out my name, and when I turned around, my family was standing on the other side of the bars.  I smiled and waved, and then Jay lifted his arms up like he wanted me to pick him up.  In that moment, I felt like biting through the bars like a wild lion to get to my son.   \t“Mr. White, it’s time for you to return to your cell,” the officer said, jarring me from my fantasy world.   I turned and looked at him with hatred in my eyes.  Even though he wasn’t responsible for me being in prison, I felt a hatred for him in that moment that raged and threatened to boil over.  He lowered his head as he led me into the strip search room.  I felt numb as I stripped out of my clothes.  All I could do was think about the look of disappointment that crossed Lil’ Jay’s face when he realized that I wasn’t able to pick him up, or leave with them.   With each visit, our bond grew closer, but the sense of heartbreak that I felt each time my family left the visiting room never left me.  When I returned to my cell from my first visit with my son, I climbed into my bed fully dressed.  I turned on my Walkman and listened to Sade until I dozed off.  It was nearly three o’clock in the morning when I finally woke up, and all I could do was sit on my bunk and stare at the photos from the visit as I thought about ways to escape from prison.   \tThinking of how vulnerable my son was without me out there to guide and protect him caused me to sink deeper into anger and depression.  I found myself on edge everyday because I didn’t know how to process all of the emotions I was experiencing.  Deep inside, I was sad and emotionally broken, but the only way I knew how to express what I felt was through anger and violence.  I developed a serious “wish a motherfucker would” attitude.  Daily, I wished a motherfucker would get out of line so that I could release my pain by inflicting pain on them.  It didn’t take long before I was able to get some of this frustration out of my system.  A week or so after my visit, an inmate, who I had had an encounter with at Carson City, transferred in.   \tWhile I was at Carson City, this guy accused me of stealing his vending machine card, and then went and told the officer working our unit.  The officer called me down and told me to empty my pockets, his eyes lighting up when I pulled my card out of my pocket.  When he discovered that it was mine, he apologized and sent me back to my cell.  I knew if I were to beat the inmate’s ass, they would know I did it, so I let it go, but I didn’t forget. When he arrived at the Reformatory, I had made up my mind that I would get him whenever the opportunity presented itself.  After two weeks or so, I caught him slipping.  We had a substitute officer working the unit so it was the perfect time to act.  When they broke our cells for chow, I waited for the guy to walk down the tier, then approached him swiftly.  I had already given my neighbor the heads up to walk in front of us, blocking the officer’s view.   \t“I told you I was going to get your rat ass,” I said as I seized him by the neck and pushed his head through a nearby window, shattering the glass with his face.  He screamed loudly as the glass tore through his flesh, causing a river of blood to flow down his face.  I blended in with the rest of the crowd and went to eat chow as he was rushed to the infirmary to have his face stitched up.  This was only the beginning.  That brief adrenaline rush soothed the pain for a moment, but it wasn’t enough.  I needed to hurt someone whenever I could to stop my own hurting.   It was as though I was an emotional vampire thirsting to drain the emotional blood from unsuspecting victims in order for me to stay alive.  I was quickly earning a reputation as an extremist.  Though I got away with most of my actions, it wasn’t long before I found myself heading back to solitary confinement.   \tI was working as the foreman on the chow line when my side of the line got backed up because of a disgruntled inmate who complained that he hadn’t gotten enough gravy to go on his mashed potatoes.  The brother working the window where the trays were passed through was doing his best to satisfy him, but to no avail.  All the while, our line was backing up, which meant we would have to stay at work longer.  As the foreman, it was my job to keep the line flowing, so I approached the window and asked the guy what the problem was.  He responded with a verbal attack, going on and on about our ineptitude, so I offered to fix his tray.  I scooped up a heaping mound of steaming hot mashed potatoes and drenched it with several ladles of scalding gravy.  It was a double portion, which was more than he was entitled to, but I wanted to make sure that he was satisfied because I understood for some inmates, that was the only meal they’d have that day.   \tWhen I brought the tray to the window, the inmate started complaining that there was too much damn gravy.  At that point, I had been pushed to the limits of my patience.  I asked him to come closer to the window so that I could hear what he was saying, and when he leaned in closer, I slapped him in the face with the tray full of hot potatoes and gravy, causing him to yell and holler.  My supervisor had seen the whole play, but he was cool so I wasn’t worried about him doing anything.  What I didn’t anticipate was the inmate running to the officer who was patrolling the kitchen.  When my supervisor saw the inmate take off toward the officer, he ordered me to the back of the kitchen.   \tI took off my hoodie, which I wore beneath my kitchen whites, and hid behind a large stack of pots and pans.  Within two minutes, I heard the rush of boots slapping the ground along with keys jingling, signaling the officers rushing to the scene.  My heart began beating fast as I held out hope that they wouldn’t discover me.  Much to my dismay, they had the inmate in tow when they reached the pots and pans room.   “That’s him,” the inmate called out as the officers found my hiding spot.   I stared the inmate down as the officers cuffed me up.  His face was red and he still had remnants of mashed potatoes and gravy on his face and in his hair.  In a matter of seconds, my anger had gone from 0 to 60.  In that moment, I didn’t care that my actions could have caused serious damage if the gravy or potatoes had gotten into the inmate’s eyes.  All I was concerned about, however, was the pain I was feeling.   \tWhen I reached the cell in solitary confinement, I paced back and forth like a caged beast.  With each step I took, I felt the callouses on my heart and mind thickening.  I reinforced my anger by blaming the other inmate for snitching, when in reality no one was responsible for the way things were turning out in my life but me.  I had allowed past hurts, disappointments, and betrayals to infect my soul with the worst and deadliest illnesses to invade our community what?.  At the end of the day, I was emotionally retarded, an angry boy in a man’s body.  It would be a few days before I’d learn my fate, but in the mean time, I laid in my bed, reading daily and feeding the rage.   Chapter 17 \t “I don’t care what anyone calls you.  There is never an excuse to allow someone’s words to stand in the way of your success,” my father said as we drove away from the Greyhound bus station.  I knew he would be disappointed when he learned I had been kicked out of Job Corps, but I was just as disappointed in his words.  I wanted him to understand why I lashed out.  I wanted him to understand how I felt being demeaned and treated inferior because of the color of my skin.  I wanted him to know what it felt like to have someone trample on my humanity and my right to freedom of speech.  I wanted him to know that I had a responsibility to myself, and those who came after me, to voice my displeasure with how we were treated in Kentucky.  More importantly, I wanted him to respect my right to fight for what I believed in.   What I hadn’t accounted for was the fact that my father understood in ways that I wouldn’t grow to appreciate until I was an adult.  See, my father entered the military when he was 17 and grew up during the turbulent sixties and seventies.  He lived through things that I had yet to discover, but as a 17 year old, I couldn’t relate to his lack of anger at the racism I had experienced.   \tWhen we got home, I basked in the familiarity of my surroundings.  I was excited to be at home with Vanessa and my nephew Megale.  Within a few days, I was back into the groove of being home.  It was the dead of the winter, so there wasn’t much activity on our block and I started getting antsy.  Within a week or so, I found myself back down in Brightmoor hanging out at Tamica’s house.  I reconnected with Mark, Jimmy, Mack and Coop and started hanging out on the corner selling drugs and drinking 64 ounce bottles of Old English 800.  The fellas were happy to see me, and I was happy to see them.  I had missed hanging out, fighting dogs, hustling, and chasing girls with my homies, so it was refreshing to be standing out on the corner with the crew.   \tOne day, we were on the block chilling when a customer I had never met approached us.  It was a crisp, mid-January afternoon, and when he walked up, we were sipping Old English 800 to keep warm.  The guy was more aggressive than I was accustomed to, and I immediately developed a dislike for him.  His energy reminded me of Tiny, the dopefiend who robbed me when I first started selling drugs.  Coop introduced him to me and I gave him a dry nod as they completed their business.  When he walked off, I told Coop there was something about him that I didn’t like.  Coop said he had recently moved into the neighborhood and was good business.  I chalked it up to me being gone for a minute, but my street sensibilities wouldn’t allow me to completely discard the ominous vibes I was getting from him.  I watched him walk away and reiterated to Coop that I didn’t like the vibes I was getting from him.  Coop laughed it off and joked that I didn’t really like anyone outside of the crew.  We got a good laugh and continued about our day.   \tOver the next few weeks, I found myself struggling to get back on my feet.  Things were slow and I spent most days hanging out with the crew on the corner.  I was tired of struggling, however, so I started thinking of different ways I could come up.  I was staying with my sister most of the time, but it was a strain on her because she had three boys and a husband to look after.   \tDespite having a full plate, Tamica never hesitated to take me in and allowed me to stay at her house for as long as I needed to.  She had basically raised me and was always by my side when my mother wasn’t around.  Though we were only a few years apart, she was like a mother to me.  We stayed up talking most nights about making it out of the ‘hood and how things would be better for us.  She had been forced to grow up and endured the pains of being in love with an older man who physically abused her.   \tThey argued daily, and whenever he got drunk, he would hit her and they would start fighting.  As good as my sister was at fighting, she was no match for a grown man, and neither was I.  When I was younger, I tried to intervene, but to no avail.  I had promised myself that I’d fuck him up when I got older, but the older I got, the less they fought.  I think that was largely because he knew I wasn’t going to keep standing around watching him beat my sister.   \tThings started to pick up slowly and I was able to get ahold of half an ounce of cocaine, which I cooked and cut up to sell.  Mack and Coop had built up the clientele on the block and neither had a problem with me making a few dollars.  The reality was, no one wanted to roll all day, but we didn’t want the clientele to go anywhere else, so we shared the business.   As we moved into the first week of February, things began really picking up on the block and I found myself staying up all night selling out of a spot a few doors down from Tamica’s house.  Then, on one fateful night, I happened to be lying on the couch at Tamica’s house when Coop tapped on the window. \tIt was about two o’clock in the morning when Coop came by.  I got right up and went outside to see what was up.  Coop asked if I had a few rocks because he was out and had a customer.  I told him I did, but I needed to get them out of my stash.  I went back inside the house to get my sack, which was stashed in the freezer to ensure my nephews didn’t get to them.  I came back out, gave Coop the rocks, and told him to tap on the window when he got done making the transaction.   \tFive minutes after he left, I was back on the couch knocked out.  Moments later, I heard the faint sound of someone screaming my name.  For a minute, I thought I was dreaming, but the sound grew louder, jarring me from my sleep.   I jumped up from the couch and snatched the door open to see what was going on. When I looked outside, I didn’t see anyone in front of the house.  Just as I was about to turn and go back in, I heard Coop’s baby’s mother calling my name out of a window from across the street at Ms. Cooper’s house.  The first thing that crossed my mind was Coop was about to beat her up or something like that.  Though I had never seen him hit or abuse her, I had been around enough domestic violence to trigger those thoughts.  Before I could make sense of what was going on, Coop burst through his mother’s front door holding a .357 Magnum in his hand.   \t“This bitch tried to rob me! This bitch tried to rob me!” he shouted as I approached the house.  My initial thought was that a female, possibly his baby’s mother, had tried to rob him.  This wasn’t uncommon in our line of work.  The streets were cut-throat, and anyone involved in the lifestyle was capable of any level of disloyalty, betrayal and treachery.  Before I could collect my thoughts, Coop went back inside.  I climbed the porch steps slowly as I tried to process what was going on.  Was Coop trying to pull off a classic cover up to justify not having my money?  I didn’t know what to think as I entered the house, but when I stepped through the threshold, I wished I could have turned around and walked right back out; however, my sense of loyalty and dedication to my friends wouldn’t allow me to walk the short distance back across the street to the comfort of my sister’s couch.  It was too late.  I had already committed myself, and there was no turning back. \t“Please, I’m dying,” were the first words I heard before it hit me that the man lying on Ms. Cooper’s living room floor was the same man I had met on the corner with Coop a few weeks earlier.  He was dressed in dark pants and a dark sweater, which was saturated with blood.  His breaths were labored and I could hear the gurgling of blood coming from his chest.  “I’m about to shoot this bitch in the head,” Coop screamed as he stood over the dying man. “He was going to kill my whole family. My mama, my sisters and my baby is in here,” he continued. \tIt took me a few minutes to calm Coop down.  I begged him not to shoot the man in the head in his mother’s house.  By this time Ms. Cooper had come out of her bedroom, so I went to talk to her and calm her down.  As the man lay on the living room floor taking his last breaths, Coop explained to me what was going on.  The man had come by earlier and bought some rocks, and then returned carrying the .357 and a pocket full of ammo.  Coop let him in, then came and got some rocks from me to sell to him.  When he returned, the man pulled the gun on him and told him to get on his knees.  He removed a bullet from his pocket and told Coop to bite it to show that he wasn’t playing.  He told Coop that he would kill everyone in the house if he didn’t show him where the rest of the dope was.  Coop said that all he could think about was his daughter, mother and sister as he sat on his knees staring down the barrel of the .357.  It was these thoughts that gave him the courage needed to attack instead of becoming a victim. \tIn a burst of adrenaline, Coop rushed the man, picked him up, and then slammed him on the kitchen floor.  The force of the bodyslam dislodged the gun from the man’s hand. Coop scrambled to get the gun, and in one motion, fired into the man’s chest.  The man then crawled into the living room where he collapsed and laid dying.   \tOnce I got Coop calmed down, I told him to have his mother call the police and report the robbery attempt so that he could avoid getting charged with anything.  Unfortunately, however, knowing that his family could have been murdered was clouding Coop’s judgment.  He said that he wanted to take the body across the street and dump it in the backyard of the vacant house next to Tamica’s.  I tried to talk him out of it, but he was determined to move the body from his mother’s house.  I knew it was a mistake, but there was nothing I could tell him to convince him otherwise.  All I could do was try to be a friend according to my understanding of what friendship meant in my seventeen-year-old mind.   As we stood in the vacant yard staring down at the man, I was devoid of feelings.  I didn’t care that the man was lying dead.  I rationalized my feelings by saying that it could have easily been Coop and his family.  Looking back, it sickens me to think that at such a tender and fragile age, I had already developed a callousness around my heart that would prevent me from having human compassion and empathy.  I was lost in thought about how the night could have ended when out of nowhere, Coop fired several more shots into the man’s body.  To this day, I think those last few shots masked what Coop really wanted to do, which was cry.  His family had been threatened and he had been made to bite a bullet, and no man ….   \tCoop left where did he go?, then came back and told me to tell my sister to call the police in the morning and let them know that the dog had found a body in the backyard.  In the meantime, I told him to go to a family member’s house and we would take care of the rest.  Instead of leaving, however, he went down the street.  The next morning when the police arrived to investigate, Coop came and joined us in the backyard.  Once the homicide detectives investigated the scene, they concluded that the body had been carried from Coop’s mother’s house because of the trail of blood left behind.  They questioned Ms. Cooper and arrested Mack, thinking he was Coop.  The detectives said there would have been no charges had the body not been removed from the house.   \tCoop eventually turned himself in and was given a bond for $5,000, which his brother Boe paid.  When he got out, we celebrated, but it was short-lived because we knew that he would be going to prison.  It was during one of these celebrations that Coop told Boe, if he could trust anyone to hold him down, it would be me.  From that night forward, Boe and I began building a bond.  He had just lost his best friend, and now his brother was being sent to the joint.  While Coop was out on bond, he hung out with the crew and enjoyed the rest of his freedom until he was sentenced in May of 1990 to five years in prison. \tOver the next few months, I started selling drugs exclusively for Boe, which cemented our bond.  The spring was upon us, and with the warm weather, it felt like our clientele was growing by the day.  Mark, Mack, Boe and I stayed on the porch from sunup to sundown selling drugs and drinking.  Blackstone was off the hook, and everyday there was something going down, from fights to parties.  Despite the fact that we were selling drugs, most of our neighbors loved us, especially the neighborhood girls.  They all wanted to be down with the guys from Blackstone.  There were other crews in the area that we played ball with, and sometimes did business with, but Blackstone was the heart and soul of Brightmoor at that time, and for years to come.   \tThings were going pretty well until March 8, 1990 when the last remnants of my childhood were shattered by a rapid burst of gunfire.  Like a crystal decanter exploding into a million shards of glass, my life was broken into pieces when an argument over a girl turned to gunplay.  I was seventeen years old, and almost twenty-three years later, I can still feel the frosty winter air dancing over my teenage flesh as the gunshot wounds to my leg and foot sent waves of pain through my entire body.  I remember where I was standing when the gunman drove by, what I had on, who I was with and where we were headed; but more than anything, I remember the intense heat that raged through my body as the first bullet met its mark. When the first of three bullets tore into my flesh, I felt my shinbone cracking from the force of the bullet.  Immediately, my shoe filled with blood, which sloshed around as I fled the scene trying to escape my assailant. One bullet still remains lodged in my foot as a reminder of how fragile life can be in the ‘hood. As I recall that fateful day, the scene of my shooting plays out in my mind vividly in slow motion.  I can see the car pulling up to the corner where I stood talking to Boe. When I looked up and saw the driver, I knew something was wrong.  We exchanged angry glares before I invited him to get out of the car to fight.  Something in his facial expression told me that he had no intention of fighting.  A smirk crossed his face as he reached down and retrieved his pistol.  My response told him that I wasn’t armed, and he took advantage of that fact.  My reaction time was slow, and before I could turn and run for shelter, he squeezed off several shots, hitting me with the first two in the leg while the third bullet hit me in my foot as I fled for safety. My heart pounded in my chest like a jackhammer as adrenaline flooded my system, and my legs pumped like pistons as I zigzagged back and forth, dodging the fusillade of bullets that the shooter unleashed in a fury.  As I ran, I prayed that none of the bullets hit me in my spine, or even worse, in the back of my head. I ran around the corner into this young lady named Lisa’s house.  She had witnessed the whole incident play out and was mortified as I approached her.  She begged me not to come to her house, but I ignored her requests.  I ran right past her and through her front door.  I gathered myself in her kitchen, then exited the side door.  When I opened the door and saw that the coast was clear, I ran back around to my block.  My emotions boiled and raged like a violent sea storm.  My initial fear was replaced by a deep feeling of loneliness.  I couldn’t comprehend why someone would attempt to kill me over a meaningless argument.   When I returned to my block, I saw my sister, friends and nephews standing outside.  As I approached them, I started to feel dangerously angry. I was experiencing an amalgamation of emotions that began festering with the poison of revenge.  I wanted someone to feel the pain, fear and sadness that I was feeling.  Tamica was the first person to reach me.  She ran down the block and embraced me when she saw that I was still alive.  Her eyes filled with tears as we walked back to the house.  I took off my jacket and shirt, checking for bullet wounds.  I was sweating profusely and my mouth was so dry it felt as though someone had stuffed a handful of sand in it.  I ignored Tamica’s request to put my clothes back on and pulled out a pack of Newports.  Before I could light one up, I jumped up to go in the house and get a gun.  I wanted to shoot someone so bad, it was killing me inside. I hated being a victim, and the only thing that would restore balance was getting revenge.  Tamica and Ms. Cooper did their part to calm me down.  I lit up a crumpled Newport and sat on the porch sulking as I waited for an ambulance that never came.  It wasn’t a surprise to us.  We were used to ambulances and police who never came to the rescue of Black children.  This was the reality of living in the ‘hood.  Finally, after waiting close to half an hour, Boe drove me to Mt. Carmel Hospital. He reassured me that everything would be alright; my wounds weren’t that bad.  Boe and his best friend had been shot the previous year, and his best friend died on the scene.  Knowing what he had been through helped me cope with some of the thoughts that began flowing through my head. When I arrived at the hospital, I felt like I was being moved through an assembly line manned by robots. In Detroit, a child getting shot was business as usual. There was no compassion shown to me by any of the staff.  I was given a shot of Demerol before being rushed to get an x-ray.  When I awakened from my drug-induced sleep, the room was full of police officers.  They asked me a barrage of questions about the shooter. Their demeanor was callous and confrontational, as though I was somehow the cause of my own shooting.  I told them that I didn’t know who shot me.  My response incensed one officer to the point that he told me, “That’s why your lil’ Black ass is lying in the bed suffering from a gunshot wound.”  Somehow my ignorance and refusal to give him an answer upset his sensibilities.  He hurled a few more invectives at me, then exited the room.  I felt victimized all over again, but this time by an officer who didn’t give a damn about kids like me who had to live in neighborhoods that were virtual war zones.  There was a code that we lived by, and there was no way I was going to violate that code. When the doctor arrived, I felt a sense of relief.  For the first time, I felt like I could be a child and express my fears, but I was quickly reminded that we live in a cold and indifferent world.  The doctor looked at my chart and left without saying much to me.  He returned moments later with a pair of needle-nosed pliers.  He dug the pliers into my flesh and wrenched the bullet from my leg, pulling bits of meat and bone with it.  He irrigated it, then left to write a prescription for some antibiotics.  I dozed back off and was awakened by my father, stepmother, and mother standing in the room. In my father’s eyes, I could see a sense of hopelessness while my mother stood paralyzed by fear, a fear that one day one of her children would be killed.  Sadly, I was the third one of my parents’ children to be shot.  They were clearly at a loss for words.  What could they really say to me?  There were no parenting manuals to explain how to handle your child getting shot in the streets like a rabid dog.  So we talked briefly, then they all left.  I could sense their anger and frustration with me because they knew I would return to the scene of the shooting.  I had long ago given up on going home to either of my parents and had accepted that the streets were my home.  If not before, I surely felt this way after the shooting. No one hugged me or told me that everything would be okay.  No one came to talk to me and explain all of the emotions I was feeling.  No one told me that I was programming myself to be a killer in response to my fears. In my mind, I would rather victimize someone else than to be a victim.  No one explained to me that cars weren’t death chariots carrying the grim reaper.  So I became hyper-violent in order to restore a sense of emotional balance.  If I shot first, I would no longer have to fear getting shot. It was a distorted way of looking at the world, yet it was the only way I knew how to cope.  When I left the hospital, I returned to my block deadlier than the man who had shot me, killing what remained of my childhood innocence.  The anger I felt combined with the alcohol I regularly consumed cast a dark shadow over me.  I wandered the streets blind to what was going on inside of me.  Instead of crying tears, I cried bullets, screaming in semi-automatic bursts every time I found myself in conflict.  Anger became my shield and the mask I hid behind as I navigated my way through the streets.  This was the sad reality of the city I lived in.   \tBlack children get shot and killed everyday yet very few receive psychological treatment or emotional counseling, so we grow up living in fear and anger, which eventually manifests into violent behavior. Everyday, I ask myself why we are considered the dregs of society.  Columbine-like violence has been going on in the ‘hood for years, but very little is done about it.  Sometimes we march or hold candlelight vigils, but this does very little to solve the problem.  No child should ever fear being the victim of gun violence.  No child should ever feel that they must victimize someone else’s child in order to survive.  But that’s exactly what happened with me. \tOver the course of the next fourteen months, all of the violence that had been poured into my young life overflowed, leaving a trail of carnage in it’s wake like a ‘hood version of Desert Storm.  The little compassion and empathy that I had left shriveled up like a prune, leaving a cold, hard lump of apathy behind.  I had officially crossed over to the world of heartless killers who were legendary in the ‘hood, young men who squeezed triggers out of desperation.  I became obsessed with carrying a gun like a crackhead carries his pipe.  I went to bed with my pistol, woke up with it, and took a dump with it in my hand or nearby.  At the first sign of beef, I was ready to shoot it out. My mind became fixated on the ghosts that lay in the shadows ready to shoot or hurt me, so I made up my mind to shoot first.  I knew it was only a matter of time before the cumulative effects of my paranoia ended with me shooting someone. Chapter 18 \t It was my second time in the hole, but this time around, I was a lot more aware of what to expect caged up for 23 hours a day.  I quickly developed a routine – sleep through the morning and read late into the night amidst the chaos – and made the necessary mental adjustments to survive the... Why were you in the hole? Where? When my father came up to see me, I had been in the hole for about 30 days.  I was shackled and handcuffed, then led up to the visiting room where my father awaited me.  They put me in a non-contact visiting booth where my father and I sat talking through a three-inch thick Plexiglas window for how long?.  We tried having a normal conversation, and my father did everything in his power to comfort me with warm words and thoughts from home.  Though his words were well intended and I smiled in response, deep inside, they wrecked on havoc my emotions as I thought of the things I would never witness on free soil.  I knew the little sisters that he spoke of would be women when I got out of prison and life in the ‘hood would continue on without me.  I knew my son who they were caring for would never get a chance to throw a football with me, or have me teach him the basics that fathers teach their children.  These were thoughts I didn’t want to face, so I pushed them deep down to the bottom of the rock that had become my heart.  \tWhen my father left, I went back to my cell and lay on the bed thinking deeply about things from his perspective. I could see that he was tired and hurt from seeing me caged up, so I wrote him a letter.  I told him that he wasn’t responsible for the choices I had made in my life and he shouldn’t feel guilty.  I didn’t know how he would receive my letter, but I wanted to be sure that he understood he was not the cause of the decisions I had made.   \tAfter about six months in the hole, I was released back to general population and immediately reclassified to the kitchen.  When I found out I would working in the kitchen, I was very excited to reconnect with the brothers I had been building with.  Unfortunately, however, I was assigned to the morning detail, which I hated with a passion.  I have been nocturnal for as long as I can remember, so getting up in the morning has always been a struggle.  I managed to overcome my disdain for the morning shift and ended up working in the kitchen commissary.  It was a cool spot to work because I had access to all the food, which I smuggled out through other inmates.  On the flip side, only a few inmates had access to our area so I couldn’t build with the brothers the way I wanted to.  After awhile, I requested to be transferred to the midnight bakery where I worked with two of my comrades Simba and Mallon.  Every night when we were done with our work, we would kick it in the bakery, eating and reading whatever books we had smuggled, which we discussed at length with each other.  Things were going well and I was enjoying being able to build with my brothers, until I got called in early one morning for overtime.  \tWe had gotten off the night before at about two o’clock in the morning, so I was pissed when they told me to report to work at 6 a.m.  We discovered that a bread run had been messed up, and one of the morning supervisors wanted us to make some more.  I told him that I wasn’t baking shit and wanted to go back to my cell, so he fired me and wrote me a misconduct.  I decided right then that my days in the kitchen were over. Why?  Although I’d miss building with the brothers, … \tGetting fired gave me more time to build with the brothers on the yard.  We formed coalitions and had intense study groups with other organizations and a few curious brothers.  Our organization was undergoing continuous changes as spiritual advisors and security heads were transferred or voted in and out of positions.  I continued to be a disciplined and dedicated brother, and the rest of the brothers looked to me for guidance.  I had never considered being a spiritual advisor and preferred supporting brothers like Tommie X and Simba, who I felt were more spiritually inclined.  However, when it was my time to assume the position, I rose to the occasion.  I started challenging the Board of Directors to think of different ways to educate the brothers.  With the help of brothers who had inspired me, I tried to change the culture of the organization to a more revolutionary and militant one.  Instead of the Bible and Quran, I encouraged the brothers to read books by Assata Shakur and George Jackson.   \tNot long after getting out of the hole, I was given a job working in the recreation center.  It was the perfect place for me as the spiritual advisor because it gave me access to every yard, so I was able to talk to my assistants and security staff on a regular basis, which allowed us to forge a stronger bond.  I was now in control of the callouts and could set up meetings whenever I wanted under the guise of a basketball or weightlifting callout.  Whenever we had a beef on the yard, we were able to coordinate and strategize in a way that allowed us to attack with stealth.  When someone who? did something in J-Block, it was easy for us to have someone placed on a callout from I-Block to take care of it.   \tAs our battles (with other organizations?) intensified and hits were ordered on other inmates, I found myself battling contradictions in the way I did my bid.  On one hand, I was teaching the brothers that White supremacy and fascism were the enemy, and in the same breath, I was ordering the stabbings of other inmates – inmates who had brown flesh like me, and were therefore being smothered by the same blanket of oppression that smothered me.   I started growing tired of the countless and fruitless beefs that I either intervened on or had others stabbed over.  I could feel the weight of the crown hanging heavily on my head yet I understood these were the rules of engagement at the Gladiator School.  Eventually, the weight became too much for me to bear, and I resigned from my post.   I was starting to feel like a fake ass hypocrite, and this was something I was uncomfortable with.  I turned over the position to Simba and stepped back to reassess where I was heading in life.  I was growing in my consciousness, but the gravitational pull from the negativity and violence of prison life was overwhelming.  I found myself constantly battling my thoughts and everyone around me.  The only peace I found was when I was in the recreation center working out. \tI hit the weights with a vengeance and honed my pool skills two or three times a day.  The weights helped alleviate some of the stress, and being around good people helped with the rest.  We worked for the coolest staff at the Reformatory, and we had one of the best crews.  My homeboy Mo Bounce worked in the rec center with me along with E Love, Roland X and Deombre X.  In between yard breaks, we worked out and played basketball.  We also took time to study and build.  It was around this time that I wrote my first article for the prison newspaper. I hadn’t given it much thought after I wrote it, but a month or so later, it was the source of a conversation that would change the course of my life.   \tWhen I arrived at work one day, I found our supervisor Tom, who was the coolest officer ever, sitting in the recreation center reading the paper.  He kept looking up from the paper and at me with a curiosity that I hadn’t recognized before.  After reading my article in (name of the paper), he asked me if I had really authored the article.  I assured him that I had, and he told me that I was a good writer.  In fact, he wanted to share the article with his wife who… why?.  I didn’t think anything of it, until he returned to work the next day and told me that his wife thought I had a future as a writer.  I had never really thought of writing as something to take seriously, nor did I have an inkling to be an author.  I simply wanted to get out of prison and go on with my life.  I never thought of being anything other than free.   \tThough in that moment I didn’t realize the impact that conversation would have on my life, Tom’s words resonated with me.  I went back and reread the article, trying to pick out of it what Tom and his wife had seen, but I couldn’t find it.  In my mind, it was just a simple story about something that a member of my family was experiencing and how I felt about it.  Even still, I found Tom’s positive reinforcement encouraging; he made me feel good about myself and my writing.  It had been a long time since someone said something celebratory about me that wasn’t connected to street or prison violence.  I was actually being told that I was good at something other than hustling drugs and hurting people.   \tWhen I went back to my cell, I pulled out a notepad that I had been using to jot down my thoughts.  It was then I realized that I was a budding writer.  It hit me in that moment that I needed to get a typewriter.  I didn’t know when, but I knew at some point, I would have to get my own typewriter, which became a tool of liberation for me.   \tI continued working in the recreation center, which was the heartbeat of the joint.  Every hustle imaginable took place there, from drug trafficking and loan sharking to gambling and playing pool for money.  To some degree or another, our recreation crew was at the center of it all.  I had several hustles that allowed me to take care of myself.  I loaned money at 100% interest and enforced a strict code of payment.  If you were short with my money, then I doubled it again for the next draw day.  If you still didn’t have it, you may as well had checked into protection because it was guaranteed you would be getting stabbed or hit in the head with a lock and sock.  It wasn’t personal; it was simply the business model that had been established in prison long before I ever committed my first crime.  \tWithin how many months, I had firmly established my position in the prison and was well revered by those who knew me or came in contact with me.  The inmates could always count on me to be fair, and one of the things that separated me from others was my diplomacy.  In the midst of conflict, I always tried to find a way to ensure that we all got what we wanted in the end.  I wanted my money and they wanted their lives, so I was willing to work with them.  However, if they were unwilling to work with me, they undoubtedly knew that I was coming to get what was mine.   \tDuring the summer of 1996, things between several of the organizations and their officers started heating up.  Two officers who ran the yard at the Reformatory and a few officers in the units had become more and more brazen with their abuses, and we were tired of dealing with it.  We organized silent protests, unified workout regimens, and other tactics to let them know that we were uniting together.  The officers retaliated by setting up some of the leadership, and I found myself on the receiving end of one sergeant’s harassment.   With the escalation of stabbings in the recreation center, the officer started shaking me down every chance he got, destroying my cell on a daily.  I never got caught slipping, however, so there was very little he could do.  Eventually, he got me transferred to another prison, but the war waged on.  Not long after I transferred, several officers were jumped, and one was nearly stabbed to death.  While it was good to hear about the officers getting what we felt they deserved, it was the stabbing of an officer that would send my life on another sharp turn down the prison drama streets. \tI was transferred back to Carson City for the second time and had no idea what was going on at the Reformatory, or how it would impact me.  The eleven or so months that I was at Carson City, there was constant tension in the air between the officers and us.  I had returned to my post as a Melanic and was eventually voted to be the spiritual advisor.  I hadn’t been in the post long before I ordered a hit on a known informant that tried to come to our service.  It was business as usual, but I was able to justify my actions because he was a known rat who we all despised.  Even though the officers’ investigation came up short, we (the organization or a few brothers?) were placed under a cloud of suspicion.  This created another wedge between our organization and the staff.  They did everything they could to break us down, and we did everything we could to antagonize them.  \tIn addition to my Melanic brothers, I had been reunited with several of my comrades from the Gladiator School.  Tommie X, Mo Bounce, E-Way, Yella and my homeboy Boise were with me at Carson City along with a few more solid brothers.  It made our time more bearable as we were able to support each other and keep each other hopeful.  It was tough, but we continued to share books and information whenever we could.  As time went on, I found myself emerging as a true leader.  I read everyday and challenged my comrades to grow with me.  Instead of preaching to them about doing right, I challenged the contradictions we were all guilty of from time to time.  We went back and forth daily as we worked out in an effort to harmonize bodies with our minds and spirits.   \tOne day while we were outside working out, I noticed a few officers going in and out of our unit.  They looked like they were preparing for something, but I didn’t know what was going on.  There hadn’t been any beefs brought to my attention, and all of the brotherhoods seemed to be relaxed.  I went back to doing push-ups, and just as I was coming up from a push-up, an officer approached me and asked for my ID.  I gave it to him, then braced my body for what I knew would be an invasive body search.  I hated for the officers to touch me, but he surprised me when he handed my ID back and walked toward the unit.   \tWhen I finished working out, I went in and hit the shower, then headed back to my cell.  I joked with my bunky Timmy about a shakedown we had received a few days before.  Timmy was from the ‘hood and was a good kid who was serving time for a murder that no one in the neighborhood believes he committed.  He was a church boy, and the rumor was, he took the fall for a family member who refused to come forward. He was a phenomenal basketball player and everyone respected him for his game.  We were different in many ways, but those differences allowed us to co-exist peacefully.  Timmy wasn’t a troublemaker, so when they snatched us out of our cell for a shakedown the first time, he was a bit taken aback.  We continued to joke about it, until we heard someone hollering down the tier that the police were coming down the tier.    \tBefore I could get to the door to see what was going on, our cell door was banged open and I was asked to step out of the cell.  As soon as I stepped out, several officers surrounded me and told me to get against the wall.  They searched me violently before placing me in handcuffs, then escorted me to the hole.  They talked back and forth between each other as though I weren’t there.  Though they tried their best to speak in code, I picked up that there was something going on about an officer at another prison getting stabbed, and somewhere in the midst, my name had surfaced.  I knew nothing about the stabbing that they mentioned, so my mind started racing.  The last thing I needed to add to my prison file was my involvement in the stabbing of an officer.  I was escorted over to the hole, and before I could collect my thoughts, I was shoved into a dingy cell.  It dawned on me that I would die in prison if I were found guilty of putting a hit out on an officer.  \tWhen the officers left my cell, I came to the door to see if there was someone else around me that I knew.  I called out a few names of the brothers I knew had been taken to the hole over the last few days.  My homeboy E-Way was the first to answer the call.  We stood at the cell door talking as I tried to figure out what was going on.  Our conversation was interrupted when an officer returned and told me I would be transferring in the morning.  E-Way had already been told he was transferring as well, so we assumed we were going to the same prison.  We ended our conversation with the understanding that we would be able to talk on the bus in the morning.  I didn’t realize it would be the last time I’d see him; we were sent to different prisons, and years later, after he was released, he died in a fatal shooting that is still unclear to me.  \tThe following morning, I was transferred to Oaks Correctional Facility.  It was my second stint in a maximum security prison in less than five years.  Instead of moving forward as I walked the years off of my sentence, I was going backwards and making a bad situation worse. Chapter 19  \t When I looked in the rearview mirror and saw the Michigan State Troopers behind us, I knew in my soul they were going to pull us over.  It was the first time since we had fled Warren, Ohio that I had given any thought to whether the plate on the car we were driving was legit.  Before the thought could fully register, I saw the red and blue lights bouncing off the back window of our car like a disco ball.  I looked in the front at Frank, who was driving, and his eyes were calm as he pulled over to the side of the road.  His father Punchy, who sat in the front passenger seat, told us to let him do all of the talking as the trooper got out of his vehicle and approached our car.   Punchy was a slick-tongued hustler from the era of notorious drug crews who ruled the streets of Detroit in the eighties like the Pony Boys and Young Boys Incorporated.  His street pedigree was as thorough as they came, and I was confident that the officer would send us on our merry way, or maybe I was just crazy enough to think that our luck would never run out.  \tThe trooper had a pleasant disposition when he approached the car and asked if we knew why we had been pulled over.  We told him no, and he explained that we were driving over the speed limit.  He quickly asked for license, registration, and proof of insurance, none of which we had.  Punchy began talking, but before he could get out a complete sentence, two unmarked police cars pulled up alongside us.  Within minutes, we were spread eagle on the side of the road as the officers tried to figure out where the key to the trunk was located.  They searched us and relieved us of the money we had before their sergeant radioed in that they were clear to break in the trunk.  When the trunk popped open and the M4 semi-automatic was exposed, the officers went into overdrive with their searches and questioning.  They quickly separated us and began interrogating us one-by-one before hauling the three of us down to the station.  They threatened us with charges that far exceeded what we ended up getting charged with, but we all refused to make a statement.   \tWhen the officers finally informed us that we were being charged with receiving and concealing stolen property over a thousand dollars, we were relieved because we knew we would be getting out on a low bond, or so we thought.  The following day, we were charged for the four guns that they found in the trunk and given a bond of twenty thousand dollars.  The prosecutor told the judge that he felt we were a flight risk so he requested a higher bond.  The bond itself was the least of my worries, however; I was more concerned with what they might discover while I was in custody.   \tA few months earlier, Frank had come to me with an offer to set up shop in Ohio.  He told me that his uncle had a house for us in Warren and it would be a very lucrative venture with great growth potential.  I had only known Frank a short time, but he appeared solid so I told him I would consider it.  I ran things down to Boe, and Boe agreed that it was a good business opportunity.  He suggested that I do a trial run, so a week or so later, I got on the Greyhound bus with a .38 revolver tucked in my waistband and a family-sized bag of Frito Lays with about two thousand dollars worth of rocks in it.  Punchy and Frank sat in the back of the bus and I grabbed a seat in the middle.  My palms began sweating as more passengers boarded the bus.  I surveyed each person’s face to see if any of them looked like police or were suspicious of what I was up to.  When the bus finally pulled off, I exhaled deeply and reshifted my focus to the task at hand.   \tAfter a bumpy three-hour ride, we arrived in Warren, Ohio and went to work immediately.  I gave Frank’s uncle T-Bone some sample bags of rocks to take to the strip and pass out to other smokers.  When he returned, he told us that some people would be stopping by.  I was a bit skeptical, but chose to roll with the flow.  We sat around drinking brews for a couple hours before we decided to call it a night.  I dosed off on the couch, and within an hour or so, Punchy came to me and told me that he had a customer who wanted to buy some rocks.  I got up to serve him, and it was then that I discovered we could mark the prices up three times what they were in Detroit. Rocks that we normally sold for ten or twenty dollars were being sold for forty and fifty dollars.  Before the night was out, I had made nearly fifteen hundred dollars.   Within two days, I had sold everything I brought with me, so we went back to Detroit to get more dope.  When we returned, I told T-Bone that I needed to find another spot because him and his wife had three young children staying there in addition to their teenage daughter Nycci.  He told me that he would find another spot in the next day or so.   I wasn’t comfortable selling out of T-Bone’s house, and Nycci made it known that she wasn’t happy with our presence.  Whenever she came home, she gave me the evil eye and barely spoke to Frank or Punchy, even though they were family.  Back then, I didn’t fully comprehend the hell that we were putting her and her younger siblings through. We had people running in and out of their house at all times of the night, and stayed up late drinking and talking shit while they were trying to sleep.  Worst of all, we kept their parents high all day.  Despite the fact that I knew Nycci didn’t care for my career choice, I knew from the moment I met her that I wanted her to be my girl, and I made it known.   \tOne day, a young man came to the house and asked if Nycci was there.  I told him that I was her new man and it wouldn’t be wise for him to come over anymore.  When Nycci found out what I had done, she was livid, but I didn’t care; all I cared about was making her my girl.  About a month or so later, her mother told me that her birthday was coming up, and I saw that as an opportunity to show her how much I was interested in her.  While she was at work, I went shopping and got her a gift and a card.  When she returned home and saw that I had thought enough about her to celebrate her birthday, it melted the frost she had around her heart.  I asked her what she wanted to do for her birthday and she said she wanted to go to Youngstown.  We made an effort to drive up there, but their was a problem with the car, so we spent the night talking to each other and getting to know each other.  Before the night was over, Nycci was officially my girlfriend.   \tOnce we became a couple, Nycci did her best to encourage me to get a regular job and leave the streets alone, but what she didn’t account for was the fact that I was too entrenched in the streets.  Though I knew she was well meaning, her words fell on deaf ears.  I was more committed to the grind than I was to building a relationship with Nycci, but I made an effort to keep the streets away from her as much as I could.  Within a few weeks, we had a spot across the street, so I spent the days over there making money and spent the nights getting to know Nycci.   \tIt didn’t take long for me, Punchy and Frank to build our clientele in Warren, and before long, we were travelling back and forth between Detroit and Ohio every few weeks.  The money was flowing fast and I felt like I was on top of the world, until one day a bag of rocks came up missing.  I had been stashing rocks at Nycci’s house and some of them came up missing.  Nycci’s mother blamed Nycci’s godfather, and when he came to the house, we beat him severely until he lay slumped over by the back door in the fetal position.  I was in a drunken rage, grabbed a gun out of our stash, and attempted to shoot him, but Punchy talked me down.  My determination superseded his wisdom, however, and before I knew it, I had pulled the trigger, shooting Nycci’s godfather in the side.  We all froze in place because we didn’t know whether I had killed him.  Thinking of the worse case scenario, Punchy hopped into action and started setting everything in motion so that we could wrap him up and toss his lifeless body in the river.  But to our surprise, he was still alive.   Punchy decided it was best for us to rush Nycci’s godfather to the hospital.  I was unsure what the outcome would be when the hospital staff saw that he was brutally beaten with a gunshot wound in his side, but one thing I knew for sure, I wasn’t sticking around to find out.   While we tried to figure out how and when we’d head back to Detroit, Nycci grabbed her brother and sisters and fled the house.  Once we got Nycci’s godfather in the car and Punchy took off headed for the hospital, I tracked Nycci down at her friend’s house.  She was so distraught that she refused to talk to me, so I left her alone and walked back down to the house.  With each step that I took, the gravity of the situation sunk in deeper.  The look on Nycci’s face when I told her to come back to the house was a wake-up call.  In her eyes, I was no longer the slick-talking dope boy from Detroit; I was a monster with a severe penchant for violence.   Prior to looking in Nycci’s eyes, I had never given any thought to how my volatile behavior impacted anyone other than the intended target.  In fact, the damage I had caused her and her younger siblings was much more severe; they were innocent bystanders.  They hadn’t agreed to the rules of engagement that come with living life in the streets.  We had, and we understood the consequences.  Even the man I had just shot understood how the streets worked – we could get shot, killed or end up in prison the longer we played the game.  We all knew that no one got out of the game without their fair share of scars and losses; it was the cost of doing business in the streets. \tAn hour or so later, Punchy returned to the house as cool as an icicle in Alaska.  He told us that he had concocted a story to tell the hospital staff when he dropped Nycci’s godfather off.  He then told us that the beating had done more damage than the gunshot, and Nycci’s godfather was in critical condition.  Although he had assured Punchy that he wouldn’t say a word to the police, I wasn’t ready to take that risk, so I told them we needed to head back to Detroit as soon as possible.   We tracked down one of our customers who had agreed to take us back to Detroit in exchange for some rocks.  We gave him a few rocks and he gave us the keys to his car as his guarantee that he would be back in the morning to take us back to the city.  We stayed up the rest of the night talking, smoking, and drinking. Before daybreak, Nycci returned home and got dressed for school.  She was quiet and reserved, and I could sense that she was hurt and still angry.  After awhile, we talked and she agreed to let me take her to school.   I had no idea that that would be the last time I’d talked to her for a month.  In that moment, I knew what I felt for Nycci was different from what I had shared with any of my girlfriends before her.  Her opinion really mattered to me.  Knowing that she was hurting tugged at my heart, but the allure of the game wouldn’t allow me to fully embrace my feelings.  I knew she wanted me to quit the streets, but I wasn’t quite ready to let it go. \tWhen I returned to the house, Frank and Punchy hopped in the car and we left in search of our driver.  After driving around Warren for half an hour with no success, we made the decision to drive ourselves back to Detroit.  We stuffed all the money we had made in our shoes, stashed the guns we had acquired in the trunk, and took off headed for Detroit. \tWhen the State Trooper pulled us over, the events from the night before cartwheeled through my head like a gymnast; we didn’t know if Nycci’s godfather had made it through the night or if he had reported the shooting.  The troopers took us to Flatrock State Police Post before taking us to Monroe County Jail.  The Sheriffs stared at us with grim looks, and within moments, there was a quick buzz circulating through the jail.  Rumors quickly superseded the truth, and within hours of being in the bullpen, we learned that we were being investigated for everything from dumping bodies on the freeway to high-level trafficking.  Of course, we knew none of it was true, but it didn’t take away our fear of them discovering that a crime had been committed with one of the guns they took from us.  Each of us knew guys from the streets who had gone out of town and gotten caught up on all kinds of charges, so we knew it was possible for us to be charged with something we hadn’t done.   \tThoughts of trumped up charges haunted us as we sat beneath the glare of guards, waiting to find out what they had in store for us.  Monroe County had a history of racial tension and it hung in the air like Jordan in his prime. With every shift, we encountered thick-necked, backcountry, good ol’ boys who looked forward to letting us know who was in charge.  As much as I would have preferred being around Black guards and closer to home, being sent to Monroe County Jail turned out to be the best thing to happen to us.   Chapter 20 \t Oaks Correctional Facility was sterile and bland like unseasoned mashed potatoes.  The exterior of the building was similar to Carson City and all the other prisons built during Michigan’s prison boom.  When the van pulled into the back of the prison, we were met by several thick-necked White officers clad in black and grey uniforms and grim faces.  Their presence was meant to intimidate and establish dominance, but I had long ago grown beyond the point of being intimidated.  I had grown up in one of the toughest cities in America and the things I had experienced in the streets were far more frightening than any cellblock I had ever been in.  When I got out of the van, I could feel the tension as the captain made his way through the group of officers.   \t“So, you’re the bad ass who thinks it’s okay to order hits on officers,” he said as his mouth curled into a tight knot. \tI had no idea what he was talking about so I didn’t respond.  My lack of response seemed to bother the rest of the officers who stared at me as if they wanted to take me out back and lynch me.  I returned their glares with a glare of my own to let them know that I wasn’t afraid. I was ready to die if necessary and felt like I had nothing to lose, so I held my ground like a dead-game pit bull.  After a few tense moments, I was escorted inside the building and placed in one of the visiting booths while they tried to figure out what to do with me.  Two hours later, the captain returned and told me that it was my lucky day.  It turned out that the Notice of Intent form, which was required to keep me in solitary confinement, hadn’t been filled out in a timely fashion so they were forced to release me into general population.  At that point, I was still unclear why I had been snatched off of the yard, placed in the hole, and transferred to maximum security. \tWhen I finally got to general population and was able to talk to my counselor, I was told what was going on. My neighbor at the Reformatory had gotten into a conflict with an officer and brutally stabbed him.  He was a loner in prison, but I was one of the few guys he walked the yard with.  We had met in the county jail while he was on trial for killing his mother and eventually developed a bond.  When I first heard that he had killed his mother, I didn’t want anything to do with him.  I lived by the code of the streets and you were never to harm women or children.  The thought that he could kill the woman who gave birth to him just didn’t sit right with me, but when he opened up to me about what happened, I understood.   He had just returned from Dessert Storm and was shell-shocked.  He said that he saw his mother’s shadow as she moved around the house one night and thought that he was under attack by the Saudi’s.  He fired his gun out of survival.  However, in jail and in prison, most prisoners shunned him because they didn’t understand Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), even though many of them had suffered from PTSD as a result of what they experienced in their homes and communities.  Instead of judging him, I embraced him and helped him cope with the guilt that he felt about causing his mother’s death.  He had been sentenced to life in prison, but the real sentence was the feelings of guilt that he will carry with him for the rest of his life.  The more my neighbor and I talked, the more I realized how intelligent and well read he was.  We often exchanged books and had deep dialogues about revolutionary theory, African culture, philosophy, political science, and the military’s role in destroying the minds of young men.  One day, he pointed out the contradictions in the American legal system.  The way he saw it, US soldiers were being sent to war to murder others in the interests of the American government while young men were being sent to prison daily for murdering in their own interests.  We continued to build daily, and eventually he started coming to Melanic service.  At the time, I was the spiritual advisor and required security at all times.  Even though he wasn’t officially a part of our security staff, he was vigilant when it came to making sure that I was secured.  He carried two shanks with him at all times, and I knew he wouldn’t hesitate to use them.   \tWhen he got into it with an officer and decided to stab him nearly to death, the administration went back (where-files?video tape?) and reviewed all of his interactions.  They knew he had attended our service and I was the leader at the time, so they tried to say that I had ordered the hit.  Although they had no evidence to prove I had ordered a hit, they sent me to maximum security anyway.  \tWhen I got to the cellblock, I saw a few of the brothers I had spent time with at the Reformatory.  When we broke for chow, I ran into a brother named Eric Shabazz who gave me the rundown on the joint.  He told me that our Executive Deputy Spiritual Advisor was in the unit and was considering shutting down our service.  The brothers hadn’t been living up to their potential, so he wanted to shake them up a bit.  When I was finally able to talk to the spiritual advisor, he asked me to help him stabilize the brotherhood.  I agreed and shared with him some strategies that I felt would help sharpen the brothers.  I had learned early on that you needed to challenge the brothers to think and study.  I didn’t believe in anyone getting a free ride and felt that that strategy would separate those who wanted to be a part of our organization for the right reasons from those who simply wanted the cloak of protection that we provided. \tWithin my first week at Oaks, I was added to the service callout and scheduled to speak at the next service.  I gave a fiery speech about accountability and sincerity when it came to the struggle to liberate the minds of our people.  I could sense that the Executive Deputy Spiritual Advisor was impressed and his actions bore witness to that fact.  He promoted me to spiritual advisor and told me to clean house.  He wanted me to build the brothers up at whatever joint I went to from that point forward.  It was a major appointment that came with a lot of responsibility, but I was up to the challenge.  From the time I joined the organization, I had set out to build the brothers up and challenge them to be the best revolutionaries that they could be.  It was a serious undertaking, but the rewards were worth it.   \tThe rest of my time there was uneventful.  My ultimate goal was to decrease my security level, so I tried my best to stay beneath the radar.  I was classified to work in the kitchen, which I hated, but I had to do what was necessary to get my security level down.  I started off making seventeen cents an hour and eventually worked my way up to thirty-four cents an hour as a baker/cook.  Things were rolling along until another inmate sent a confidential statement to the inspector that said I was planning to take the officers in the kitchen hostage.  I was in the midst of pulling a pan of cookies out of the oven when all of a sudden, I was surrounded by several officers who told me to place my hands behind my back.  I complied and was taken into the (who’s) office where I was interrogated by the captain and the inspector.  I was pissed when I heard why they were interrogating me.  They knew that inmates who wanted to get someone else’s job would make up shit, but they decided to question me anyway.  Before I blew my top, two of my supervisors came into the office and rushed to my defense.  They told the inspector that I was one of their best workers and they had never had any problems out of me.  It worked, and the officers went on about their way.  \tI continued to work and stay out of trouble, and within a few months, I was transferred to Gus Harrison Correctional Facility in Adrian.  Though it was only a couple of hours from Detroit, there was a lot of racial tension between the inmates and guards.  In fact, not long before I arrived, a riot had erupted and they locked the prison down for about a month.  By the time I got there, the prison was still in semi-lockdown mode so movement was limited.   It was late in the evening when I reached the cellblock I had been assigned to.  When I entered the cell, I could see from his belongings that my bunky was White.  That was the first time in my incarceration I had bunked with a White inmate.  When it was time for the unit to lock down, I waited patiently for my bunky to come back to the cell, but he never showed up.  When an officer came to pack up his belongings, he told me that my bunky didn’t want to be in the cell with a Black person, and they had to take him to solitary confinement because he refused to lock up.  Within a few days, they put another guy, who I found out was a rat, in the cell with me.  He had snitched on a female officer who took care of business for a few of my guys.  When I found out who he was, I told him that he had to move out of the cell or I was going to kill him.  He left and never returned to the cell.  I eventually got a bunky I could get along with, and we did our time in a way that didn’t interfere with each other.  \tWhen I got to Adrian, I could tell the brotherhood wasn’t as tight as it should have been, so I went to work organizing the brothers and getting everyone on the same page.  As I had done at Oaks, my strategy was to get the brothers to read and study books that would inspire the best in them.  I had learned early on that if our religion wasn’t connected to our cultural reality, it was useless to our struggle, so I started introducing the brothers to more of the books I had read and had in my personal collection.  I put a lot of emphasis on brothers reading Assata Shakur’s autobiography because I believed hearing the truth from a woman would have a powerful impact on them.  I also intensified our physical training to ensure that we were balanced in our development.  We cooked (explain) and ate together nearly everyday to make sure all of the brothers were eating and their basic needs were met.   \tPeople started to take notice of how organized the brothers were becoming, but there was one brother who mentioned it every time he saw me.  The first time he said something, I took it as a compliment.  Then, I noticed that he kept talking about this one brother who he claimed had been acting different ever since I arrived.  The second time he mentioned something, I told him that it really wasn’t any of his concern how the brother had changed and he should keep his comments to himself.  A few weeks later, the brother that he kept talking about got into a conflict, and he ran around the unit telling everyone what happened.  He had been forewarned about speaking on our business, but disregarded the warning.  I consulted with my security staff and we agreed that he was a threat to the safety and well being of our brotherhood.  He was reckless with his mouth, and that wasn’t something we could let go. If we did, then others would think it was okay for them to do the same thing.   \tAs one of the leaders of the organization, I was supposed to go into my cell once hits were ordered and wait until the security staff had handled their business.  On this particular day, however, I couldn’t return to my cell because they were running chow.  I was walking back from chow when I saw the guy running across the yard holding his face, blood pouring profusely from his wounds.  He ran right by me, headed toward the unit.  He had talked so much about so many people that he probably couldn’t put two and two together.  He went to the infirmary, and that was the last we heard of him.  Unfortunately, however, it wasn’t the last time I had to deal with conflict. \tWhen I arrived at Adrian, I was just coming off of an ACL tear that happened while I was shooting hoop.  The doctor had given me a big brace, and after a few months, I started back hooping.  I loved and loathed basketball simultaneously.  I loved the game, but hated the games that were played when it came to conflicts on the court.  Over the years, countless stabbings had taken place over missed calls, fouls, and slick talking.  \tDespite suffering a serious injury to my knee, I still made my way back to the court.  I found a crew of brothers who I could ball with, and every day when we were allowed out for our two-hour yard period, we ran half-court games.  In a matter of days, I had developed a good chemistry with a few of the brothers so we kept the same team daily.  We were nearly unbeatable, and after awhile, it became a big thing for anyone to beat our squad.  Of course, there were more athletic players who played better than us individually, but none of them could beat us because of our chemistry and unselfishness.   We quickly became the bane of this guy named Tone’s existence.  Everyday, he came out with a different team of guys attempting to beat us, only to leave the court in defeat.  It had gotten to the point that Tone started playing extra aggressive out of desperation.  It didn’t bother me, until one day he went too far.  During our first game against Tone and his team, I came out on fire.  I had a stretch where I hit several jumpers in a row.  The guys on the sideline started talking smack to Tone, telling him that he couldn’t handle me.  He said the only reason I was scoring was because I was shooting all jumpers.  I took that as a challenge and told my team to give me the ball in the post. They passed me the ball and I scored back-to-back, further frustrating Tone.  In an effort to stop me from scoring, he started pushing me in the back and kneeing me in the same knee with the torn ACL.  In the middle of the game, I told him to stop playing dirty.  In return, he told me, “Play ball!” with a sneer on his face.  I smiled to myself because I realized in that moment that Tone had mistaken my genuine concern for brothers as a weakness.  He hadn’t been in prison long and didn’t have a clue about who he was dealing with. \tWe continued to play, and he continued to play recklessly and talk shit.  A few of my guys who were standing on the sidelines watching signaled to me that they were ready to stab Tone as soon as I made the call.  I waived them off and told them that I had it.  The next time I got the ball, I went down to the post and was about to shoot when Tone kneed me again.  I dropped the ball and smacked Tone so hard that it sounded like a gunshot.  Before he could react, I choked him up and told him that the next time he disrespected me, I would kill him on the yard.  Tears rolled down his face as he looked around for someone to rescue him.    A few of the guys were laughing at Tone, saying that they had warned him he was playing with fire.   \tI knew Tone was a part of the Chicago-based street organization Gangster Disciples, which meant smacking him could lead to a bloody war on the yard, but he was in violation and I was ready to go to war to defend my honor.  The code of the yard dictated that the head of the Gangster Disciples address the physical assault of one of his members.  Anytime there was conflict between organizations, how the leadership handled it made all the difference in the world.  A hotheaded leader could cause a riot to erupt, whereas a levelheaded diplomat could ensure that justice and peace prevailed. \tThe following day?Later that evening Before I left my cell, I ensured that the shank I had was as sharp as possible.  I packed my property up and threw on a sweathood and boots. The prison was tense as word about our altercation blazed through the compound like a wildfire.  When I reached the end of the tier, my security personnel and a few of my homeboys were waiting on me.  They knew, without me having to say a word, what had to be done in the event that the Gangster Disciples reacted violently. \tWhen we exited the unit, I saw the Gangster Disciples walking down the walkway slowly.  I could tell that they were waiting on me to come out.  I gripped the shank tightly as I increased the pace of my steps.  As I got closer, I could see the concerned look on Chicago’s face.  He was a standup brother and the leader of the Gangster Disciples.  We had developed a rapport in the short time I was there, and neither of us wanted to intentionally compromise that.  He had been in prison long enough to know how small conflicts could turn into large wars that spread from prison to prison.  I was also conscious of the responsibility that I had to my members.   \tWhen I approached Chicago, he stepped up and greeted me.  I returned his greeting and we both gave a nod to our respective members to stand down as we stepped over to the side.  Chicago told me that he’d heard about what happened from several sources and understood my reaction.  He acknowledged that Tone was out of order and apologized on behalf of the Gangster Disciples.  Like most organizations, the Gangster Disciples had a protocol its members were supposed to follow, and that included never creating unnecessary conflict. In response to Tone’s violation, the security arm of their organization took him on the back forty and administered a severe beating.   Though the conflict had been resolved, the tension lingered in the air for a few days so we remained vigilant.  We had been trained never to let your guard down once an altercation had reached a physical level.  Under normal circumstances, I would have made sure Tone went into protection or visited the infirmary, but I followed the agreed upon protocol when it came to resolving conflict between organizations.  \tWhen things smoothed over, I took some time to think about the potential outcome of the conflict and decided to ease back from playing basketball again.  I was tired of getting into conflicts with men who were suffering as much as I was suffering.  I wanted to set a better example for the rest of the brothers as well, and I knew that would take a high level of discipline on my behalf.  I loved playing basketball, but I loved what I was striving to be as a man more.  I thought about how Malcolm and Assata would have handled the situation, and it hit me. They would have never been playing basketball in that environment in the first place.  So instead of playing ball, I intensified my workouts and study sessions on the yard for the rest of my time in Adrian. \tBy this time, I was eight years into my sentence and beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I was halfway through the minimum range of my sentence and my security level was close to being reduced.  On a visit with my father, son and stepmother, I shared the excitement I felt in knowing that I would be in medium security soon and was steadily working my way through my sentence.  Although I still had eight years until my earliest release date, knowing that I had made it through the first half gave me a good feeling.  My father told me that he was proud of how I had begun handling myself and staying out of trouble.   My father’s words meant a lot to me because I knew I had caused him so much pain and heartache.  Whenever they came to visit, my father tried to remain upbeat and focused on us enjoying the brief moments we had together.  Sometimes we would just sit and play cards, eat food out of the vending machines, and joke around.  In that short space of time, I didn’t think about the prison bars that kept me away from my family.  All I thought about was their smiles and the laughter that we shared, until it was time for them to leave.  That’s when the emptiness started to settle in.  Sometimes it happened while we were sitting in the visiting room.  At that point, I would start feeling anxious and wished they would leave, but I never told them that.  I would just sit and act as though I was enjoying their company, while inside I really wanted to be alone.   As I watched my son grow into a young boy and my sisters grow into t young ladies, it tore at my soul knowing how much I was missing them.  However, I knew that I had to keep my eye on the prize, but it was not an easy task.  A few days after my family’s visit, my discipline would once again be tested.   It was a brisk fall morning when the brothers and I hustled over to the chapel for our early morning service.  When we entered the building, I heard the chaplain in a heated exchange with the officer who worked in the chapel.  From the snippets of their conversation I could hear, I gleaned that the officer didn’t want to sit in on our service, and it showed on his face when he opened the door to let us in.   \tOnce inside, our head of security began assigning posts to the security personnel before the rest of our members and guests arrived.  Whenever a brother was assigned a post, he couldn’t move until the floor sergeant officially released them.  One of the brothers was assigned the post by the entrance, but the officer told him that he had to get from in front of the door, and he didn’t budge.  I was in the front of the chapel and saw the officer in the brother’s face telling him to get from in front of the door before he sent him to the hole.  The brother wore a stoic expression as he held his position.  I could see where things were headed, so I sprung into action to keep the interaction from escalating.  I told the security head to relieve the brother of his post as I talked to the officer.  \tI explained to the officer that we had been given permission to hold posts by the administration, but he didn’t want to hear it.  He said he was cancelling our service and sending the brother to the hole.  I told him he was overreacting and explained that we weren’t going anywhere until we concluded our service.  The chaplain stepped in during our exchange and sided with me, but the officer wasn’t having it.  As we went back and forth, the tension thickened, and before I knew it, the officer had pushed his personal protection device (PPD), leading several officers to rush over.  The brothers jumped to attention and stood ready to go to battle with the officers.  The last thing we needed was another riot, so I acted quickly.  I noticed that the sergeant who came over was our unit sergeant and the supervisor for my job in the unit.  I approached her and began explaining what had occurred as the officers and the brothers stood nearly nose-to-nose waiting for someone to give the word.   The sergeant recognized the extreme nature of the situation and told her officers to stand down.  The chaplain sided with me, but said he couldn’t do anything about the brother who refused to leave his post.  The sergeant told me that she had no choice but to place him in the hole, but said she would let him walk back to his cell to pack his property after our service.  It wasn’t the kind of news I wanted to hear, but I was wise enough to know that it could get out of hand if I reacted out of anger.  I told the brothers what was going on and we agreed to continue service, then support our brother while he was in the hole.   \tWhen we got back to the cellblock, we had a meeting to discuss the next steps.  We knew it was only a matter of time before the administration would try to break up the leadership and ship us off to different prisons.  Several of us had been down that road before so we started preparing for a transfer of authority.  I was saddened by the fact that our coterie of solid brothers was going to be broken up.  We had developed a very solid bond, which made our time less stressful.  I knew I could count on the brothers for anything, and they knew that they could count on me.   When the officers finally came to get me a few days later to pack up for my transfer to Muskegon Correctional Facility, it was heartbreaking.  Through our battles, I had developed a genuine bond with the brothers who were there, and I felt like they were family.  Before I left, the brothers rallied around me and bid me farewell, but promised to keep in touch.  Little did we know, that would be the beginning of the end of our organization as we knew it.  The next time we saw each other, we would have to operate clandestinely.   Years earlier, when I first read about J. Edgar Hoover and COINTELPRO, I had no idea that such tactics would be employed by the prison administration to dismantle the Melanic organization.  But indeed, COINTELPRO was just as relevant and disruptive in 1999 as it was in 1969. Chapter 21 \t As I lay on the cracked, wooden bench bolted to the wall in the bullpen of the Monroe County Jail, I started to think about where my life was headed.  I had no desire to live my life in captivity, but all of my actions up to that point said something different.  I lost count of how many times I had been arrested in my young life.  Both of my brothers were incarcerated, so I couldn’t say I didn’t know any better.  Despite their situation, I continued to walk down the same path that led them both to prison.   \tI was jarred from my thoughts by the sound of loud banging, which caused all of us to look up.  Across from us, an inmate was having what turned out to be a psychotic episode.  Within moments, a legion of officers rushed into the cell and pummeled him into submission before handcuffing him and leaving him on the floor. In that moment, all I wanted to do was wake up from what was turning out to be a nightmare.   \tMoments after the excitement died down, I drifted back into thoughts about my life.  I made a small promise to change my life if I got out.  Conversations that I had had with Nycci flowed through my head in a steady stream.  She had encouraged me on several occasions to get a job or go back to school.  She believed in me even when I didn’t believe in myself, and that made me smile.   I wasn’t on a tier with a phone, so I couldn’t call Nycci.  I missed her raspy voice and smile, and all I could think about was how overjoyed she would be to hear from me.  The following morning, we were moved to a different tier, and the first thing I did was rush to the phone.  I called Nycci collect and lit up like the sun when she answered. Sadly, my excitement was short-lived.  Nycci broke down crying as she told me that she couldn’t handle me being in jail.  She then told me that she was through with me because she didn’t want to jeopardize her safety or sanity.  I promised her that I would change if she gave me a chance, but she had seen too much in her young life.  She had been lied to and deceived by her parents, so she understood the pathology of the streets and how it manifested in people, even in those you loved.   \tWhen I got off of the phone, all I wanted to do was go to my cell and go to sleep, but I couldn’t.  The jail had rules that restricted us from returning to our cells during certain times of the day, so I grabbed a roll of toilet paper off of the ledge and lay on the floor, using the toilet paper as a pillow.  I was super tired and had seen other inmates do it, so I followed suit.  Before I could fall into a slumber, I heard a guard calling my name for court.  We were being arraigned on charges of receiving and concealing property over a thousand dollars for the stolen guns.   \tFor the next week or so, I fell into a routine, which consisted of sleeping as much as I could and playing basketball whenever they allowed us to go to the recreation center.  When our preliminary trial date finally arrived, I was tired and worn down.  I was ready for it all to be over so that I could find out our fate.  Boe had paid for two lawyers, and when we got into the courtroom, they approached us and told us how to conduct ourselves.  I prayed that they would let us out, but I had no idea how things were going to go because they had caught us with four) guns that had been reported stolen.  Although I knew nothing about the legal nature of possession, I figured we were going to prison for awhile if we were found guilty.   \tThe prosecutor called the arresting officer to the stand and asked him to describe the arrest.  He started off explaining how he noticed us going above the speed limit and pulled behind our car.  He then told the prosecutor that he pursued us to the Monroe and Wayne County border as he ran our plates, then followed us into Wayne County before hitting his lights and pulling us over.  All the blood drained from the prosecutor’s face as she realized that we had been arrested outside of her jurisdiction.   \tShe shuffled through a pile of papers in front of her, then called a side bar with our lawyers.  Moments later, our lawyers came over and told us that they were dropping the charges, but would continue to detain us to see if Wayne County wanted to pick us up on some outstanding warrants we had.  Our warrants were for misdemeanors, so the sheriffs told us it was unlikely that Wayne County would waste the time coming out to Monroe to get us.  They took us back to the tier where we stayed until nearly midnight.  \tWhen the midnight shift came on, the sheriff told me that we were being released and needed to call someone to pick us up.  I called my sister Tamica and asked her if her and her husband could come get us.  Within an hour, they were calling my name to be released.  We changed out of our county blues and back into our street clothes.  As I tossed the county blues, I discarded all of the promises I had made to Nycci, my father, and myself as I walked out of the door. \tWhen we got back to Blackstone, Boe and the crew were waiting on us.  I was excited to celebrate with my crew, but Boe had other things in mind.  While everyone around me was celebrating and drinking 40 ounces of Old E, Boe asked me to step outside on the porch.  He started checking me about some of the decisions I had made, and told me that I was being too reckless.  The way he saw it, carrying guns interfered with us making money.  That was a point of contention between us from day one.  Boe understood that gunplay was a part of drug dealing, but he also knew that it brought a different kind of heat and attention to what we were doing.  It was understood that you could sell drugs all day and make a lot of money before the police came searching for you, but the moment someone got shot or murdered, the heat was on.   \tI listened to him and didn’t say a word because I knew he was right and had the best interests of our team at heart.  However, I wasn’t interested in putting the guns down.  I felt like guns were the only way to establish and maintain our respect in the streets.  I told him that I would chill with the gunplay, but I wouldn’t stop carrying a gun.  When we finished talking, we went back inside and partied with the rest of the crew.   \tWithin a few days, Frank, Punchy and I decided to go back down to Warren.  I couldn’t wait to see Nycci and the kids.  Even though she had told me that she never wanted to be with me again, all of that changed when I pulled back up in Warren.  She fell into my arms and we continued our relationship as if I had never left.  Our business had also picked back up so we started bringing other guys down there to help us expand our territory.  It was always fun to bring the new dudes down because the girls loved guys from Detroit.  For some of them, it was their first time feeling like a celebrity.  Things went smoothly for a few months.  We were making more money than we had ever made in our young lives.  Every week, we took trips back and forth between Detroit and Ohio.  After awhile, we started getting into beefs with the locals who were mad because we were stealing their women and making more money than they were making.  They started sending crackheads to our spot to steal, and one night, after they had pulled a jack move on one of my workers, I decided to come over and take care of it.   Earlier that night, a few crackheads rolled up to our spot and asked my worker to let them see the rocks before they made a purchase.  When he pulled out the rocks, they slapped the rocks out of his hand, causing them to land in their car, then pulled off.  When my worker told me what happened, I was pissed.  I put on all black and stood in the back of the parking lot of the spot where we sold dope.  When I saw the car pull over, I went over to serve them.  I placed my hand in the window to show them a few rocks, and just as my worker had told me, one of the guys slapped the rocks out of my hand and tried to pull out of the parking lot.  But before they could reach the end of the lot, I riddled the car with bullets, shooting the driver in the shoulder.  I then slipped back into the darkness and headed back to the house.   \tIt didn’t take long for word to spread that a Detroit guy had shot what turned out to be one of the local dealer’s uncle.  Word around town was that the local hustlers didn’t take kindly to the fact that I had shot another guy down there.  Despite the gossip circulating about them seeking revenge, we continued to open up spots and make money.  We were still bringing guys from Detroit, but had also started employing guys from Warren.  I found that some of the guys I brought from Detroit were more focused on the girls in Warren and hanging out than they were on getting money, so I sent a few of them back. \tOne night, Frank and I went to check on one of the spots that we had a guy from Warren working.  When we arrived, we knew something was wrong because the woman who lived there was acting strange.  Our worker was also seemed kind of nervous when we asked him about the sales for the day.  He said it had been a slow day so he didn’t have much money for us to pick up.  We had been selling out of the spot for a few weeks and had never had a slow day, so I knew something was amiss.  I asked him to go get the sack we had given him, and when he returned, I immediately knew that he had messed up.  The rocks were small and the bags looked like they had been tampered with.  I asked him what happened to the rocks, and he told me that they were like that when I gave them to him.   \tI looked at Frank, and before the guy could begin explaining, Frank slapped him with a pistol, knocking him into the wall.  As he bounced off of the wall, I delivered another blow, which staggered him, but before he hit the floor, he took off running up the stairs.  Frank started shooting at him as he fled and he jumped out of the second story window as we gave chase.  When we got back downstairs, the woman who lived there stood in the kitchen shaking and in tears.  She begged and pleaded with us not to harm her and assured us that she had nothing to do with him messing up the sack.  It turned out that he had shaved the rocks down and used what he shaved off to trick with women who came to the spot looking to buy drugs.   \tWe didn’t think much of what we had done because we had been in the cycle of chaos and destruction for so long that it was like another routine day.  We hadn’t accounted for the fact that we were in a small town and things that we saw as petty or insignificant were magnified down there.  Within a couple of days, more rumors had been circulated, and before we knew it, people were saying that the police were looking for us and had given the locals the green light to exact revenge on us if they caught us slipping.   \tThere was a lot going on in my head at the time.  I was frustrated over a few drug deals that had gone wrong, and I was blowing more money than we were making.  I also owed Boe a large amount of money.  Instead of telling him that I had messed up, I decided to keep what we made and buy my own weight down there to sell until I made enough money to pay Boe back and keep my thing rolling.   We sought out a few guys from New York to see if they had something for sale, but no one seemed to have anything.  We eventually ran into some guys from Detroit and decided to cop from them.  What we didn’t know was that they were down there to hit a quick lick and then leave.  We bought what turned out to be two ounces of fake crack and that put us back considerably, so we decided we had to shoot back to Detroit and deal with the fallout from messing up Boe’s cut of the money.  I knew the onus of responsibility was on my shoulders because I was in charge.   Once we decided it was time to head back to Detroit, we gathered all of our clothes to take to the laundry mat.  We had washed our things and was heading back to the house when a car rolled up on us and started shooting.  We had left our pistols in the house, so we had to duck a fusillade of bullets without firing back.  Once we made it back to the house, we figured out where the shooters had come from.  It turned out that the guy who worked for us and was shaving down the rocks was the brother of one of the local dealers. It was set in our mind that the beef was on.  Even though we were leaving out within a few days, we were set on getting revenge and leaving our mark on Warren, Ohio.  Over the next two nights, we located all of the drug houses that we thought were associated with the shooters.  For two nights in a row, we terrorized the local dealers.  We kicked in doors and shot our way into several spots.  One time, we caught one of them slipping.  He was pulling up to a spot we had just robbed, so we shot up his car and robbed him and the lady he was with.  When it was all said and done, we wanted them to know that Detroit had come through.  \tAfter our reign of terror, we packed up and headed back to Detroit.  It was a bittersweet return because I knew I was going to miss Nycci and the money we were making.  In that short amount of time, Nycci and I had been through a lot and I had started growing in love with her.  The disease of addiction had wreaked havoc on her life, but she was determined to succeed.  All I could do was offer her words of encouragement because I was in no position to take her and her siblings away from the madness, nor was I ready to leave the streets alone.  Her spirit of determination inspired me and I wanted the best for her, even though I knew I couldn’t provide it.  I knew that she loved me and wanted the best for me as well, but I was hell bent on doing things my way.  It was hard leaving Nycci behind, and I struggled with the decision, but in the end, I knew it was time to go home and get a fresh start.   Chapter 22 \t I had heard a lot of things about Muskegon Correctional Facility (MCF) throughout my incarceration.  Over the years, it had earned a reputation as one of the best prisons an inmate could be transferred to.  Ironically, it also had a reputation as one of the most dangerous prisons because guys got comfortable very easily.  It was one of the only prisons in Michigan that allowed inmates to ride bikes, play golf, and hang out anywhere in the prison most of the day.  However, a few incidents, including a couple of inmates who took a guard hostage over an unpaid drug debt, a mini-uprising and several brutal stabbings, had caused the administration to tighten things up a bit.   \tWhen I arrived, it was in the heart of the summer and the sweltering heat was nearly suffocating.  My blues were drenched with sweat and I was ready to take a shower; however, before we were assigned a cell, we were taken to quarantine to be processed into the prison.  I had gone through this same old routine with each transfer from one prison to the next.  I hated every part of it because I never knew when I would have my own property, or be able to take a shower.  I also hated the thought of adjusting to a new bunky.   Within a half an hour, I was assigned to a cell, which was occupied by a brother who was days away from going home.  When he told me that he would be getting out in a few weeks, a small knot grew in my stomach.  While I was happy to see a brother leaving, I was saddened by the reality that I wouldn’t be walking out of those doors behind him.  I had long ago blocked out thoughts of what it would be like to be released from prison – I knew that was the only way I could keep myself from going insane – so it was difficult to be in a cell with a guy who was only days away from reclaiming his life on the streets.   \tMy bunky gave me the rundown on how the prison worked as we waited for count to clear.  When count cleared, I went down to the dayroom to get a feel for the joint and see if there was anyone there that I knew from other joints, or if there were any Melanics.  I didn’t notice anyone who looked familiar, so I just sat back and observed the vibe of the unit.  I could immediately see the difference between the higher levels and the lower levels.  A lot of the inmates were laughing and joking as if they didn’t have a care in the world.  This was in stark contrast to being in close custody where the majority of inmates were serving sentences from ten years up to life.   \tThere was also a difference in how the inmates interacted with the officers.  In the higher levels, the relationship between the inmates and the officers was very antagonistic, but at MCF, every time I looked up, an inmate was in an officer’s face.  I knew right then that I was going to hate being there.  I thought about everything I had heard about the facility and how nice it was, and that made me even madder.  I had no desire to be in a beautified version of hell; I never wanted to be under the illusion that prison was okay.  Whenever someone asked me how I felt being in a lower level, I told them that I hated it, and they immediately retreated to silence.  No matter how manicured the lawns were or how many recreational outlets MCF had, it wasn’t a substitute for freedom.   \tWhen they called us out for chow, I walked in the back of the crowd to get a sense of the joint and further explore who was around me.  When we exited the unit, I marveled at how large the compound was.  As we walked past each unit, I heard a few guys hollering my name out of the window.  They asked if I needed anything and told me they would see me when the yard opened up.  I felt a little better knowing that some of my guys were there, especially some I hadn’t seen in a few years.  When yard opened, it was like a Michigan Reformatory reunion.  There were a lot of brothers there who I hadn’t seen in years and it felt good to reconnect, even though our circumstances were what they were.   \ttheyMy homeboy Lorenzo Jewell gave me a rundown of the yard and introduced me to some of the brothers, I eased into my regular routine – working out and studying.  I enrolled in school and everything seemed to be moving in a positive direction.  I had a pretty good routine by the time my father, stepmother and son came to see me on a visit.  I was proud that I had made it down to level three and couldn’t wait to share the news with my family.  My father told me how proud he was, and that increased my desire to get my level lowered even more.  We had a good visit talking about life and all of the possibilities that lay ahead for us.  My father reminded me that I was more than half way through my sentence so the worst was behind me.  His words were encouraging and gave me a different perspective on where I was in my sentence.   \tI returned to the unit feeling good about our visit.  It made my day to see my father and stepmother get excited and smile for the first time in awhile.  After visits, I always thought about how my incarceration impacted my family and how much I wanted to get out.  I not only yearned to free myself, I also wanted to free my family from the prison I had created around their lives.  \tThe summer was moving along quickly and  our Melanic brotherhood  was  preparing for the Day of Remembrance celebration where we honored the memory and legacy of the millions of Africans who were enslaved or died during the transatlantic slave trade.  This was a time for us to reflect on our ancestors and see how we could make a positive contribution to the world on their behalf.  We fasted for twenty-four hours in preparation for our annual banquet, which was held in the chow hall.  I was one of the featured speakers and I talked about the sacrifices made by Nat Turner, an enslaved African who planned one of the greatest revolts on American soil in an effort to liberate our ancestors from bondage.  I explained to the brothers that Nat Turner was a brave man who took up arms against his captors, but his greatest sacrifice was risking his life to learn how to read so that he might be a better leader.  This was a point often overlooked by the brothers.  It was easy for us to focus on taking up arms because that was the reality for many of us growing up in the ‘hood, but not many understood that the written word proved to be Nat Turner’s most powerful weapon.   It felt good sharing moments like these with the brothers, and when the ceremony ended, the younger brothers gravitated toward me.  I represented the balance and integrity that they had been seeking.  They told me that they were inspired to learn more so that they too could lead and make a difference when they were released.  Feedback like this was one of the things that made the struggle worth it.  Being a member of an organization came with many challenges, from battling the officers who hated what we stood for to battling some of the elder brothers who were stuck in the old prison mindset “might makes right.”  It was these conversations with the younger brothers that fueled my desire to teach them more about our glorious past and our personal responsibility to our community. (what do you mean?). \tOnce the buzz from the ceremony died down, it was back to business as usual.  As fall arrived, I was feeling good about things.  The chill of fall always made me feel optimistic.  It was a symbol that the year was coming to an end and a new one was beginning, which meant I was one step closer to knocking another year off of my sentence. Freedom was beginning to feel more and more tangible, and I started thinking more optimistically about my future.  I clung to anything inspirational as a sign of things to come, like Serena Williams claiming her first US Open title on September 17, 1999.  All things considered, life was good, and over the next few weeks, things were smooth sailing.  That is, until one fateful moment when everything I had learned came crashing down on me and I was put to the ultimate test.  \tOn a crisp fall day in October 1999, my chances of ever getting out of prison were almost stripped away forever and I was once again returned to the hellish existence known as the hole for nearly five years.  It all happened on a cold Friday morning.  The day started off normal enough, or at least as normal as a day in prison could be.  I went to breakfast, and then to school.  I had been at MCF for two months by this time and was really feeling good about where I was in my transformation at that stage of my incarceration.  That was the first time I had been placed in a lower security level, and I knew this was a step closer to going home.   When I initially arrived there, I decided to sign up for the Automotive Technology class that they offered.  It was one of the better vocational classes in the system, and upon completion, the job prospects were good.  The class was interesting and I was learning a few things about cars that I knew would be beneficial if I stuck it out.  But I have to admit, I always looked forward to Fridays, which was the last day of class.which was the only day we didn’t have class.  I really hated getting up early in the morning during the week, so when the emergency count siren began blaring, I was a happy camper; it meant I would be out of school early and we had the whole weekend ahead of us.  The teacher dismissed us and we walked back to our respective units.  As I entered my unit, my bladder was on the verge of exploding and I knew I had to make it to the bathroom we were locked down for count.    \tThe sound of the siren pulsated throughout my brain; it was a sound that I had grown familiar with over the years.  At some point each month, it was blown to signify emergency count, and we all had to drop whatever it was we were doing and return to our units.  The only other time the siren was blown was when there was a serious assault, murder, rape, or an escape attempt.  The frequency of the siren often depended on the joint.  In prisons like the Michigan Reformatory and the State Prison of Southern Michigan in Jackson, it could be heard more frequently. \tWhen I reached the top of the steps in my unit headed for the bathroom, I noticed several inmates scurrying in and out of the bathroom.  It was their last ditch effort to relieve themselves before they locked the prison down for the next hour and a half.  As I approached the bathroom door, I knew there was going to be a problem.  The officer standing at the door disliked me because of an incident that occurred a few days earlier.  It all started when I was released from class early because our teacher was absent.  It was during our morning yard period, and when I returned to the unit, I approached the desk and asked the officer to write me a pass to yard.  At the time, he was engaged in a conversation with a new female officer.  He looked up at me contemptuously and refused to write me a pass.  I was not moved by his refusal because I knew I was entitled to go to yard according to policy.  My citing of the policy compelled him to write me a pass, but deep inside, I knew it would not come without a price.  I figured he would, at a minimum, go and shake my cell down and throw my meager belongings around.  However, I had desensitized myself to the value of property so I wasn’t really concerned about the shakedown.  I had grown to understand that in order to survive in prison, I could not afford to grow attached to anything or anyone.      \tHe knew I didn’t fit the mold for the complacent, subservient inmates he was accustomed to dealing with.  I wasn’t supposed to challenge his authority or quote policy, even though he was clearly in the wrong.  As he saw it, I was supposed to walk away with my head lowered, mumbling to myself.  But I refused to accept inferior treatment just because I was being held captive.  To him, my refusal was the equivalent of a recalcitrant slave defying the authority of the plantation overseer.   \tThat was not the first time I witnessed the superiority complex common among White officers rear its ugly head.  In fact, this superiority complex is deeply embedded into the psyche of those White officers whose first contact with people of other races occurred when they were hired, and could be activated by what appeared to be a shallow victory by an inmate.  There was just no way he could let a “nigga” get away with outsmarting him.  This was something I had come to learn through observation over the years.  Even the officers who professed to have no racial prejudices were prone to exact revenge on a Black inmate if they thought he had gotten over on them.    \tThis dynamic is an indictment of the racial reality of America.  Some White people cannot come to grips with the fact that Black people deserve to be treated with the dignity and respect that’s due all human beings whether we are incarcerated or not.  When I started my incarceration, I vowed never to be one of those who bowed down, and I intended to do my time with as much of my humanity intact as my circumstances would allow.   I had been working every day to better myself and learn all that I could in order to deal with my anger and bitterness, but I realized that this rubbed a lot of officers the wrong way.  As long as I refused to joke with the officers, waste my time playing cards and sports all day, and spent my time cultivating my mind, body and spirit, I would be perceived as a threat.  This was a reality that I refused to run from, and a reality that nearly cost this officer his life, and me, the rest of my life in prison.     \tAs I approached the bathroom, the officer asked me where I was going in a sarcastic way, indicating that I would not be allowed to use the facilities.  I told him that I was going to the bathroom, and he responded, “I don’t think so,” as he let other inmates go in and out of the bathroom.  My choices had been narrowed down in a matter of seconds as the officer wasn’t wavering.  I could either accept a disobeying a direct order misconduct, or I could urinate on myself or out my cell window, neither of which honored my humanity.  To this day, I would still choose my dignity over the prospect of a misconduct.   So, I brushed past the officer and entered the bathroom.  The few inmates who were in there hurried out; they all knew about me and my previous confrontations.  I had recently spoken at the Million Man March Anniversary Celebration in the prison auditorium and had used words and names that conjured up images of resistance.  Words like revolution, self-defense, Black Panthers, Nat Turner, George Jackson, Assata Shakur, and Malcolm X.  I used those words not to incite, but to share our historical legacy.  I wanted them to know that not all of our people sat around twiddling their thumbs and tap dancing; that there were strong African men and women who took a stand for justice.  But these were the kind of words that the prison administration held secret meetings about.  \tUnfortunately, there were a lot of inmates who talked the talk, but very few who were willing to take a stand for anything, and it was those cowardly men who ran off to the comfort of their cells when they saw me push past the officer in order to use the bathroom.  \t“That’s an assault on staff,” the officer barked as I used the urinal.  As his words echoed in my ears, a brief view of the situation flashed through my mind.  I knew I had a disobeying a direct order misconduct coming, but I hadn’t assaulted him.  If I had, he would have immediately pushed his PPD.  I was vexed at the thought of a trumped up charge.  As I washed my hands, the officer and I exchanged glances.  There were still a few inmates in the hallway standing around trying to see what was going on.  A few of them pleaded with him to let me out of the bathroom.  He responded by ordering them to lock up.   \t“Give me your ID,” he demanded, blocking my exit from the bathroom.  I informed him that I didn’t have it on me, then asked if I could leave.  He smiled sardonically, which made me realize that this was a sick game that he was enjoying immensely.  The whole scene reminded me of a schoolyard bully who continues to shake the life out of a kid even after he tells him over and over that he doesn’t have any lunch money.  In this case, no matter how many times the officer asked for my ID, I couldn’t give him what I didn’t have.   \tThe officer continued to egg me on.  “You’ll produce an ID or you won’t leave out of here,” he warned as he stepped so close to me that I could feel his hot fetid breath on my face.   It felt like the whole world was closing in on me.   I attempted to slide past the officer, and that’s when I heard the word “nigger.”  The officer hadn’t moved his lips, however, only his hands.  He pushed me in the chest demanding that I produce an ID that I didn’t have, and all I could hear was the harshness of the word “nigger” echoing in my head over and over again, telling me that I was less than and my personal space could be violated at anytime.  I thought of all the Black men who had been dragged from their beds in the middle of the night kicking and screaming, their cries silenced by the thick rope that was wrapped tightly around their necks before they were hoisted into the air and left to hang from trees like strange fruit.  I thought of all the Black women who had been raped in slave quarters while their husbands stood by helplessly, holding in all of their rage to keep his family from being brutally beaten or murdered.     \tA sense of calm came over me before I attacked with the fluid motion of a panther.  I responded instinctually, drawing on survival skills that had been honed in the alleys and streets of Detroit.  With each blow I landed, I felt a weight lifted.  I felt free from all of the oppression I had experienced at the hands of racist officers and unjust prison policies.  I now understood what Frederick Douglass felt when he whooped the overseer who sought to break his spirit.  I was no one’s slave, and I would rather die or live the rest of my life out in prison than allow anyone to trample over my dignity.     \tAs I stood over the officer choking away the racism, the unearned superiority complex, the 400 years of violence and oppression that African people had endured, I felt liberated, even as another officer twisted my hands behind my back.  Several officers dragged the officer, who was now unconscious, into the bathroom where they fought to save his life.  Meanwhile, two other officers cuffed me and escorted me to the hole.   Before I left the building, I looked around at the inmates who stood by watching the whole scene play out, and I was deeply hurt.  When I looked into their eyes, I saw contempt and anger, all directed at me.  It was then that it clicked in my head.  I had exposed the talkers for what they were, a bunch of  slaves who would kill each other at the drop of a hat, but refused to stand up for their own humanity.  It was a sad and costly day for me, but it was also a moment of epiphany.  I felt condemned by the brothers who I loved and wanted more for, and that was far worse than anything the State could have ever done to me.     \tAs I sat in the hole that first day, I asked myself some very serious questions.  I sat alone in my cell, staring out of the window at the inmates walking by below and wondered if Nat Turner had felt what I felt when two slaves turned him in to the slave master.  I wondered if Malcolm X felt the way I did as he took his last breath, slowly dying from gunshot wounds inflicted on him by the very people whose lives he was trying to save.  As I thought about all of my ancestors who had taken a stand for justice, only to have their own people turn their backs on them, I couldn’t do anything but shake my head.     \tWithin two hours, several officers came to my door and told me to back up to the door so that they could handcuff and shackle me – I was being transferred.  I was then hustled out to a waiting van, which shuttled me to Oaks Maximum Correctional Facility.  It would be my second time at the prison, but my first time serving time in the hole there.  I would soon learn that it was by far one of the worst places a human being could find himself.    \tWhen I arrived in the control center, several officers stood around in a small circle holding handcuffs and shackles.  The officers who brought me in had to get their cuffs back so they were forced to switch without freeing my hands and feet in the process.  The switch with the handcuffs went smoothly; however, when they got down to my shackles, they discovered that the officer at MCF had placed the shackles on upside down in his haste to get me out of Muskegon, which made it difficult for one of the officers to get his key in the lock.  He attempted to twist the shackles around so that he could see better, but that caused the shackles to bite into the tender flesh on the back of my ankles.   After a few frustrating minutes, another officer took it upon himself to kick the shackles, causing them to sink deeper into my flesh.  We exchanged glares, and I warned him if he put his feet on me again, he would find himself lying in a hospital bed alongside his co-worker.  He glared at me without saying anything, but he didn’t kick the shackles again.  Once they made the switch, I was escorted down to 5-Block and introduced to Michigan’s version of hell on earth.   \tI was immediately placed in a shower cage and strip-searched, then taken to a temporary segregation cell.  As the officers opened the cage, they threatened to slam me to the ground if I made any sudden moves.  I laughed inside because I knew they were cowards who didn’t want any problems.  It was quite amusing that people who were supposed to be responsible for our rehabilitation could be more criminal than those who they were supposed to be helping.   Over the next couple days, I felt like an animal in a zoo exhibit as officer after officer came to my cell to see what I looked like.  They were all curious about the “monster” they had heard so much about and needed to see me for themselves.   Over the next four and half years, a lot would change in how the officers perceived me and how I perceived them.  In fact, that experience would mark the beginning of a very powerful transformation inside of me.   Prior to this last experience in the hole, I was a very bitter and angry young man.  Like all the other guys who felt they were dealt a bad hand in life, I was vexed with the world.  This attitude dictated how I responded to situations, and during the first couple of years of my incarceration, my anger and bitterness had intensified to a dangerous level.  But the power of redemption allowed me to conquer my demons and quiet the negative thoughts that threatened to destroy my sanity.  \tOne of the first things I remember when I was finally escorted to my cell was the unbearable smell of human despair, a smell that will forever be burned into the memory of my olfactory system.  The smell of defecation, unwashed armpits, soggy toes and spoiled booties mingled in the air with the pepper spray the officers used to extract inmates from their cells.  Within a few weeks, I was introduced to a whole new language and culture of madness.  Indeed, being caged inside of a cell for 23 hours a day breeds an animalistic mindset within the inmates and the officers.    \tIn an attempt to gain some semblance of control over their environment, the inmates waged battle after battle with each other and the officers, and the officers waged war against the inmates.  For the inmates, the weapon of choice was what we called “Weapons of Ass Destruction.”  These feces-filled bottles were smuggled to the showers or yard cages like pistols.  Inmates took deadly aim on anyone they considered an enemy, and once they squirted their shit pistols, the smell clung in the air for days. If they couldn’t get you with a pistol, they would make shit patties and slide them underneath your door.   \tEveryday, I had to wage a war inside myself to ensure I didn’t fall into the same mindset that allowed this environment to reduce some inmates to savages.  I refused to sit up and play in my own feces, or subject myself to the feces of another inmate.  The unfortunate reality, however, was that no one was immune to a misdirected attack.  There were a few unsuspecting inmates who were mistakenly doused with someone else’s bodily waste because they weren’t paying attention when they walked to the shower or the yard.   In the hole, inmates devised every way imaginable to get to their enemies, and for every measure of prevention that the officers came up with, the inmates devised a way around it.  After one incident, the officers placed bolts on all of our food slots.   One day, two inmates were arguing, and one of the them manipulated his food slot open and waited for the one of the officers to escort his enemy to the shower.  When they got in front of the inmate’s cell, he kicked the food slot open and squirted a thick stream of feces from his colostomy bag on the inmate and the officer.  No matter how many showers they took, the thought and feeling of being drenched in another person’s defecation was not easily forgotten.  The smell hung in the air like a miasmic cloud for the next couple of days, standing as a reminder for everyone else to be careful.    \tOnce the bolts were drilled into the food slots, several inmates went into MacGyver mode trying to figure out a way to jimmy the locks open, and it didn’t take long.  First, they had to slide a comb, which they attached to a piece of string, out of the top of the door while their neighbor across the hall guided their movements.  Once the comb was lined up with the bolt, they pulled the comb up until the lock came undone.  After that, all they had to do was slide a cable cord beneath the door, twist it around the knob, then continue twisting until the slot popped open and it was business as usual.         \tAnother weapon of war was sleep deprivation.  Sometimes when inmates were in conflict with each other, they’d beat on the steel toilets or walls all night with a brush or some other hard item, which of course impacted the whole wing.  Sometimes these wars lasted for weeks, or until one of them was moved to a different cell.  There was never any regard for innocent bystanders, and this often led to others being drawn into their wars.  Another method of getting even was to blow the power, which meant the other three inmates who shared the same breaker would be unable to watch the three channels of TV that we had.    Every day that I spent in the hole, there was something going on that challenged my humanity .  After the first two years, I had grown tired of seeing grown men act like children; however, instead of complaining, I sought to gain an understanding of my environment and why other inmates reacted the way they did.  But first, I had to gain an in-depth understanding of myself.   \tThough my reaction to the environment didn’t manifest the way it did with others, it didn’t mean that I wasn’t as psychologically scarred as the rest.  In fact, to some degree, the internal scars that I bore were far worse, and if I had allowed them to remain beneath the surface until I was released, the consequences could have been catastrophic.  I knew that a complete change was needed, so I set out to transform my thinking.   The Honorable Elijah Muhammad once said, “In order for a man to completely change his conditions, he must be completely dissatisfied with them,” and there was no doubt I was completely dissatisfied with my conditions.    So, the first thing I started doing was keeping a journal.  It was within the thin pages of my notepads that I found a peace of mind and was able to truly be myself for the first time in a long time.  I got down to the root of who I was as a person and realized that I wasn’t much different from those who used “Weapons of Ass Destruction.”  Inside of me burned that same rage, the kind of rage that nearly cost an officer his life, and me the rest of my life in prison.  It was this same kind of anger that clung to my back while I was on the streets, leading me to take another person’s life.   I was tired of living in a ball of anger and bitterness and tired of hurting people, including myself, but I didn’t know what to do or where to turn.  As I sat back listening to the chaos on the wing, I knew I could never leave prison the same way I came in.  I had to change.  Prison had nothing to offer me other than more anger and violence.  The officers had no vested interest in seeing me turn my life around; to most of them, I represented job security.  Furthermore, the State had long ago given up on rehabilitation, so in order to be the man and father that I was destined to be, I had to take a long and painful look at myself.   I began charting my anger by writing my thoughts down whenever I got angry.  One day, my neighbor blew my power while trying to get a light for his cigarette.  When I asked him about it, he lied, and my immediate reaction was to kill him.  To me, his life was worthless and he deserved a swift and painful death.  A few days later, after I had calmed down, I returned to my journal and read what I had written in response to my neighbor blowing the power.  I found it quite disturbing.  Despite his inconsideration and blatant disrespect, I knew what he had done wasn’t worth me killing him or inflicting any physical harm on him.    \tThroughout the remainder of my time in the hole, I continued to chart my anger and document my thoughts when I got angry.  Through this process, I slowly realized that I had some deeper issues that I had never addressed.  I started writing about how I felt about my relationship with my mother and how I felt as a child when she beat me for minor infractions.  I wrote about my parents’ divorce and how the dissolution of their marriage impacted me.  There were so many things that came to the surface as I wrote in my journal, and it felt like a great weight was being lifted off of my shoulders with each page that I wrote.  No longer did I feel the old familiar bitterness that I had carried around inside of me in a tight little ball, keeping me one provocation away from exploding.   \tI also wrote about all of the physical violence I had suffered in my life and how it made me feel towards people.  I discovered layers upon layers of scars, and eventually realized that I was like a whole lot of other young males who suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.   Like them, I had been forced to suppress my feelings for years.  There was no one I could share my pain or my fears with, and this silence began manifesting into anger and violence toward others.  The way I saw it, no one had ever felt anything for me, and so I didn’t feel like I had to care about anybody else.   When I went back and read page after page of my journal, I could feel myself growing stronger and stronger as each day passed.  As the pain from years of abuse and neglect began to dissipate, my feelings toward my fellow inmates began softening and I started becoming more compassionate toward them.    \tTo a certain degree, I already knew how the hole was supposed to impact me, and that helped me avoid falling into the abyss of despair and insanity that has claimed so many.  I knew I would leave with some indelible scars to my psyche, but I had to do everything I could to minimize the damange if I wanted to be the father that I needed to be to my children.   Everyday was a test of my will to survive as I watched the insanity all around me.  I continued to write about the things I saw and experienced, and by doing so, it felt as though I was taking the power away from them.    \tOne of the experiences I wrote about in my journal was the night a Latino inmate set himself on fire.  He was so desperate for escape from the pain and misery of solitary confinement that he chose to end his life through immolation.  His ordeal began weeks before when the officers began harassing him constantly because of his sexual orientation.  After days of harassment, he woke everyone up in the middle of the night with a loud and chilling rendition of the Lord’s Prayer.  The next day, he set the cell on fire while he was in it.  The officers rushed onto the wing and sprayed him with a fire extinguisher before taking him to a suicide watch cell.  Within two weeks, he attempted the same thing again, after which they removed him from the cell and never brought him back.    \tThe depth of the psychosis that I witnessed every day was terrifying, but the staff psychiatrist downplayed it.  He claimed that these inmates were just “acting out.”  However, I know from living in the hole around hundreds of inmates for nearly five years that isolation causes a disconnect in the deepest part of the human psyche.  There is nothing humane about being caged in a cell for twenty-three hours a day.  Add to this, all of the other stresses that inmates face day-to-day, including being neglected and abandoned by their family members, and you have a recipe for disaster.  Extended isolation is enough to cause a significant mental breakdown.  I witnessed guys who I had known for years as solid people have mental breakdowns after ninety days in the hole.    As the months passed by, I documented the wars that were waged between the inmates and the officers.  Whenever the officers did something that we felt was unjust, we flooded the wing with water from our toilets until they cut the water off.  On one occasion, as I stood by my door watching the two-inch deep pool of water ebb and flow outside of my cell, I couldn’t help but think about of the people in Third World countries who were dying because they didn’t have clean water, and here we were forced to use water as a weapon of war.  But sadly, this was the only way we had to voice our grievances and get an immediate response.  The officers knew if they didn’t pass out our mail in a timely fashion or served our meals cold, they would have to wade through water until they got porters to clean it up.  And if they played with the showers, we would beat on our doors relentlessly until they corrected their behavior.  The way we saw it, if we didn’t fight back, they would continue to run roughshod over us.    So with pen and pad, I clung to my sanity; between that, writing letters to my family and reading their letters to me, I redeemed my soul.  There were plenty of days when I felt like the hole would consume my spirit, but I fought tooth and nail to stay strong.  There were days when I swore I couldn’t take one more day smelling another human being’s bodily waste, or one more rejection from the prison’s security classification committee regarding my release from administrative segregation, but then I would sit down and write out my thoughts or read an inspirational book, and I knew I had to keep on keeping on.  My community and my family, including the brothers who had become my family in prison, were counting on me to be strong, so I fought for my sanity until the day of my release from the hole.  It was then that the true test began.    Chapter 23 \t When we were finally released from Monroe County Jail, I returned to Detroit ready to pick up where I left off, but things had cooled down on the block.  If I wanted to make any money, I knew I had to figure out a way to turn the heat back up on Blackstone.   While I was in Ohio, things had changed a lot.  Boe had moved his mother off of the block and business had slowed down a lot.  My relationship with Boe was strained, but we had started talking again.  He was out on bond for a dope case and was focused on how he was going to get from under the charges.  My sister was in the process of moving on with her life. She had separated from her husband and moved off of Blackstone(what do you mean? She left Ron.  \tI reached out to some of our old customers and told them that we were going to crank things back up, and slowly but surely they started coming back.  Things were going slow, but I was making enough money to stay fresh and take care of the basic necessities, but it didn’t compare to the money I was making in Ohio, or the money I was making on Blackstone before I left for Ohio.  However, I had faith that Blackstone could rebound and I’d be making money again soon.   \tI had been back a week or so when I took notice of our new neighbors, who had moved into the house next door to Tamica. The house once belonged to her friend Lashawn, who I had had a brief fling with.  She had moved on and a new family had moved in.  I didn’t know any of them, but it wasn’t long before I started seeing a bunch of young ladies going in and out of the house.  From all appearances, it was mostly females living there, which was right up my alley.  Our crew had built a reputation for hooking up with all the females in the neighborhood, and I knew it wouldn’t be long before I was in hunter mode.   \tOne night, I was standing outside kicking it with Mark when one of the females from next door asked if we could help them get their car started.  She was really pretty with long hair and I was drawn to her.  I later learned that her name was Michelle and her man was one of two guys who lived in the house.  We laughed about me hitting on her while her man was in the house (laughed what off?) and I thought nothing more about what was going on over there until a week or so later when I started noticing a few of our old customers stopping through.  That’s when I realized someone over there was selling dope.  My thoughts were confirmed when one of our old customers stopped by our crib and asked me if that was our operation.  I told him no and kept it moving.  Later that same day, one of the girls from next door came outside and approached me.  She had on a sweatsuit with her hair pulled back in a ponytail.  I watched her demeanor as she walked up and laughed inside at how confident she appeared to be.   \t“Do you have a pistol I can borrow,” she asked with the ease of someone asking to borrow a cup of sugar. \tMy initial thoughts were, what did she need a gun for, and why would she approach a complete stranger?  Then, I thought about the activity next door and some of the things I had seen over the years. I considered her request and thought about a small .25 caliber Raven I had purchased from one of our customers.  I told her that she could use it, but she had to return it.  She agreed, and I gave her the pistol.  I didn’t even think about the fact that I was a teenager giving another teenager a gun, nor did I think about how easily guns fall into the hands of young Black youth in cities like Detroit.  All I thought about was what I would want someone to do if I needed access to a pistol. \tLater that night, she came back to the house and I learned her name was Brenda.  She asked me if I wanted any money for use of the pistol, and I told her no.  We talked for a minute and she told me why she needed the pistol – she was at the other end of Blackstone selling crack.  She then asked me if I wanted her to take some rocks down there the following day.  That’s how my relationship with Brenda began.  It wasn’t the traditional boy meets girl and fall in love type of thing.  However it was defined, this is how we were brought together.  At the time neither of us knew where things were headed because Brenda was in hustle mode and wasn’t looking like the attractive young lady that I would later discover.  \tOver the next couple of weeks, Brenda and I spoke whenever we saw each other, but it wasn’t until I was coming down the block one day that I noticed Brenda in a different way.  She had her hair done, a little makeup on, and was dressed up like a young lady.  She had piqued my interest and I had obviously piqued hers according to one of my homegirls.  Within a few days, our brief conversations grew in length and we started hanging out together.   \tOn the exterior, Brenda had been hardened by the streets of Brightmoor and a rough upbringing.  It didn’t take much for her to fight and she rarely backed down.  However, the more I got to know her, I saw a young lady with a heart of compassion who was loyal to her family.  Sadly, like many Black youth growing up in dysfunctional homes, her golden heart had been calloused by neglect, hurt and heartbreak.  Together, we were like two birds with broken wings trying to find solace in each other.   \tOur relationship started off cool and we enjoyed each other’s company.  We laughed and joked most of the time or just sat in the backroom of their house kicking it.  It wasn’t long, however, before the mercurial nature of our personalities began clashing.  Brenda didn’t believe in holding her tongue whether she was right or wrong, and I refused to be spoken to in a disrespectful manner.  When we had our first argument, we nearly came to blows, and at that point, I should have known that it wasn’t going to get any better.  I was raised not to hit women and didn’t believe in demeaning or degrading them either, but nothing in the father/son handbook had prepared me to deal with a girl as volatile as Brenda.   I had been around men who thought nothing of hitting women who they felt were out of line, and I always despised their behavior.  To me, hitting women was a sign of weakness and an indication that they were out of control; however, I never condemned any of them.  I knew so many guys who dealt with conflict that way that it wasn’t out of the norm.  Personally, I had no desire to travel that route, but one day I found myself faced with a girl who wouldn’t back down. \tIt all started with the fellas chilling next door kicking it.  Brenda’s cousin Michelle was eavesdropping and overheard her man JB saying something she disapproved of.  Before we knew it, Michelle burst through the door cursing him out.  JB made her go next door, then followed her over to the house while the rest of us lingered around drinking and talking.   After awhile, I went next door to check on JB and discovered him and Michelle in the room fighting.  When I knocked on the door, Michelle started cursing me out, telling me to get the fuck off of her porch.  I had never disrespected her, so I told JB to check his girl because she was out of line.  I didn’t know he was going to start beating on her, otherwise I would have left it alone.  \tI stepped off of their porch and all I could hear was screaming and banging.  I felt bad for Michelle, but before I could even process what was going on, Brenda burst out of the house accusing me of starting the whole thing. I told her to calm down, but she kept cursing and talking shit.  Her verbal assault continued for several minutes before I told her to shut the fuck up before I beat her ass.  That was the first time she had seen me that angry, but instead of seeing that she had gone too far, she continued to egg me on.  I ran up on the porch to get to her, but she ran into the house and locked the door.  She then proceeded to curse me out even more, joined by her sisters and cousins.  I had been drinking and my anger was boiling and raging hot like lava.  I told them that I was going to beat all of their asses when I got in the house.  They laughed and mocked me as I stood outside of the window.  After awhile, I said to hell with it and went back inside my crib.   Moments later, one of our friends named Derrick came over and we started to talk.  He asked where JB was and I told him next door.  He had made his way over to the house and was standing on the porch when I came back outside.  I walked over and stood behind him so that they couldn’t see me, and when they opened the door to let him in, I rushed through the door.  Without giving any thought to my actions, I hit Brenda in the face and grabbed her up. Derrick attempted to grab me and calm me down, but by then, I was too far-gone.  I hit her a few more times and threatened to shoot her sisters and cousins for getting in my business.  I was in a rage and was determined to make her respect me.  I didn’t realize that I was losing it.  I had crossed lines I said I would never cross, and did so with relative ease.  I had intentionally hit Brenda and threatened to shoot her family members.  Sadly, when we made up a few days later, it became a long running joke between us. While that incident was the first, it was certainly not the last time Brenda and I would clash.  Like me, Brenda and her sisters had seen so much violence and heartbreak that fighting each other had been normalized.   Over the next few weeks, Brenda and I continued our relationship and eventually moved in together.  We sold crack together and did what we felt was necessary to survive at the time.  We had customers coming to the same place we laid our head, so we were extra vigilant.  We had several guns in the house and I never doubted whether Brenda would use one, if necessary.  We had both seen enough to know that no one was to be trusted, and at any given time, a customer could become an enemy, or a rival dealer might try to set us up.   It was a fast, hard life characterized by desperation and hopelessness.  With each day, I drank more and more in an effort to numb myself from the madness around me.  I wasn’t happy, and no matter how much money we made, it wasn’t enough to heal the deep wounds that I had on my heart and soul.   \tOur days and nights started merging into a blur of shopping trips to Northland Mall, eating at restaurants, and throwing impromptu parties at cheap motels.  We spent money recklessly and found ourselves always playing catch-up because as fast as we made it, we spent it.  Like most dealers, we were living for the moment so we didn’t have an investment or savings plan.  We also had no long-term plans to get out of the game or do anything substantial with the money we made.  The game was up and down, and for a minute, we found ourselves struggling to make ends meet.  So, essentially we were risking our lives for what amounted to a minimum wage job.   \tAfter a few months, things were really picking up and I started doing business with Brenda’s cousin’s boyfriend.  We went half on various amounts of crack and split the profits.  We went from making a few hundred dollars a day to making a couple thousand every few days.  It wasn’t King Pen status, but we felt like we were moving in the right direction.  I started saving more money to buy larger quantities and felt like it was only a matter of time before I would be making a lot of money.   \tThe timing couldn’t have been better because Brenda thought she was pregnant.  I was excited when she broke the news, but a little hesitant to embrace the fullness of her revelation.  I had already suffered a devastating blow from a young woman named Sherita who played games with me about being pregnant with my child.  When Sherita and I hooked up, she was living with her son’s father, but when she found out she was pregnant, she told me that it was my child.  I told her that I would do my part to take care of the baby if she was sure it was mine.  She said she was sure, so we started planning for the baby’s arrival.  However, every time she got mad at me, she would tell me the child wasn’t mine.  Despite the growing doubts I had, when the baby was born, I embraced her in my heart as my daughter.   Unfortunately, I had no legal standing when it came to seeing my daughter so I was at the mercy of her mother.  One night, I couldn’t take being denied what I felt was my right to see my daughter, so I took her from Sherita.  She told her son’s father and he came over to the house where we were chilling.  I had just left the house, but Mark was still there and the two of them got into a shootout that left Sherita’s son’s father and her sister shot.  One of my aunts told me that I needed to take the baby back to Sherita, and that was the last time I had my daughter on my own.  It would be twelve years later before my daughter and I would finally reconnect.   \tOver the next couple of weeks, Brenda started to show signs of pregnancy, including morning sickness and weird eating habits.  At night, we laid in the bed kicking it about the upcoming birth of our child and what we wanted for him or her.  The reality of bringing another life into the world changed our focus about hustling.  We talked about saving enough money to move and get away from it all so that we could get a fresh start.  At the core of our being, we both wanted better for ourselves and our child; we just didn’t know how to get out of what had become a vicious cycle of dysfunction.  At night when we were laying up talking, everything sounded good; however, when the morning came, it was right back to the cold reality of the dope game.   \tOne day while we were sitting in the living room, Derrick came by and told us about this party around the corner.  He said the guy needed a DJ and asked if I was interested.  I told him that I was and we set up an agreement for me to do the party.   The next day, Brenda and the rest of the crew went shopping to get fresh for the party. It had been awhile since we had all gone out to a spot to party, so we were super excited to cut loose for a minute.  I think I was more excited than anyone else because I would be DJing for the first time in a long while.  Music was one of my passions, and I loved nothing more than watching people dance to whatever symphony I composed.   \tWhen I arrived at the party, people had already started showing up, which was a good sign that the party was going to be live.  Within an hour or so, the backyard was packed and the party was in full swing.  Everyone was drinking and smoking, but I was chilling because I didn’t want to get too drunk while I was spinning.  That didn’t last long because a few of my homeboys from my other ‘hood came through, and before I knew it, they were passing around Old English 800 and Seagram’s Gin.  Once I started buzzing, I let someone else take over the turntables and went to drink with my crew.  We had a table in the back of the yard and started dancing and acting silly with each other.  That was the first time Brenda and I had been to a party together and we were having the time of our lives, until gunshots rang out.   \tPeople started running out of the backyard screaming and hollering.  I pulled out my pistol and told everybody in our crew to follow me out of the party.  When we got to the front of the house, I ran into one of my homeboys who told me what happened.  When I learned that Derrick was the one shooting, I became very alert.  I didn’t know if the beef was with someone we didn’t know who might come back and retaliate, or if it was with someone we knew.  Derrickwas nowhere around, so I had no way of gauging the situation.  I told Brenda that it was best for us to head home, so we left and started walking back around the corner.  Before we reached the house, a Jeep pulled up on the side of us and I slowly eased my finger around the trigger of a .380 that I had in my pocket.  I didn’t even pull the pistol out of my pocket because I had already planned to shoot through my jeans if I saw any sign that they wanted beef.  It turned out that they were only looking for directions.  I breathed a sigh of relief and continued talking to Brenda until we reached the front of our house.   Just as we were preparing to go inside, another car pulled up in front of the house and the car window lowered slowly.  All I could think about was how vulnerable we were, but I was ready to go down in a blaze of gun smoke. Once again, I found my finger resting in the familiar comfort of the trigger and was prepared to shoot.   \t“Yo Jay, you on?” a familiar voice called out from the backseat of the car.  \tI told Brenda to go inside the house as I headed over to the car with Mark not far behind.  When I reached the car, I noticed two White men who I had never seen before in the front seat, and Tom, who was one of my favorite customers, sitting in the backseat with a handful of cash.  He was known to spend several hundred dollars each time he stopped by, but this time he had more money than I had ever seen him with.   \t“Yo, why you bringing people to my house I don’t know.  You know the rules over here,” I responded with a bit of irritation in my voice.  \tEven though we were selling out of our house, we limited who we allowed to come over, and we never welcomed strangers.  Too many guys we knew had been set up to be robbed or busted, and I wasn’t about to take any risks no matter how much money they talked about spending.  I conveyed this to Tom and we started arguing.  I told him that I thought he was trying to make a deal for the police and I wasn’t going to serve him.  He continued trying to make the deal, and at that point, I was really suspicious so I told him to get off of the block.  I took a step back from the car and was about to go inside the house when Tom called me back over and begged me to make the deal.  I refused, and at that point, I was irritated and getting pissed off.   \tI told Tom that he had five minutes to get off of the block, and that’s when one of the other passengers joined in the conversation.  He told me that I couldn’t make them go anywhere.  I turned to Tom and told him again to get the fuck off of the block.  His friend told me to fuck off; they weren’t going anywhere.  I asked them if they were the police because I had never seen any of my customers come in the ‘hood and act so brazen.  I asked them to leave for the last time and Tom’s friend continued shouting out of the car.  That’s when I pulled out my pistol.   At that point, Mark was like, “Fuck them, Jay.  Let’s go in,” and I started walking toward the house.  I had taken about three steps when Tom’s friend opened, or attempted to open, the car door.  Thoughts of getting shot flashed through my head and I spun back around with the pistol in my hand.  The guy said something else, which I can’t remember to this day.  All I recall is the feeling of danger that I felt, and in response, I fired several shots into the car before they sped off headed toward Fenkell. \tIt was nearly three o’clock in the morning and it was hard to see, so I never saw the guy’s face or if he had anything in his hand or not.  Although I didn’t know where the shots I fired had landed, something in my soul told me that something terrible had happened.  In that moment, I knew the guy had died, long before we found out for certain the following day.  I had shot several people before, but this time was different.  I felt empty, afraid, and alone.  I knew I had fucked up and there was no reversing what I had done.  I had allowed my anger and paranoia to consume me in such a way that I developed a reckless disregard for human life.   The gravity of the situation hit me as soon as I went back in the house.  It’s like everyone knew that the shots were fatal. For the first time I saw a level of fear in the faces of my friends that I had never saw before. something was wrong that was different then before (what do you mean?).  We all packed up, locked the house down, and headed over to Brenda’s cousin’s house.  I told Brenda that I knew I had killed him, and she broke down crying in my arms.  The consequences of living the street life had manifested in our lives in the worst way.  Here it was, Brenda was pregnant and ready to welcome life into the world, and I had just robbed a family of their husband, father, son, and brother.  In that moment, I prayed that it was all a bad nightmare, but sadly, it wasn’t. \tBrenda and I discussed going on the run together, but we were naïve and immature.  A couple days later, the thought of living life on the run was dashed when I was arrested and charged with open murder.   Chapter 24 I was not having a good day – I mean, no day in prison was good – but I had seen better.  They had just picked up the trays from lunch and the unit was loud as usual.  Normally, I would have just blocked out the noise with my thoughts, but I couldn’t.  I had too much on my mind.  I was ready to get out of solitary confinement and the wait was unnerving.  It had been nearly two weeks since my file had been sent to the security classification committee for review.  \tThis was the fourth time my file had been reviewed by the security classification committee. The first two times, I knew I didn’t stand a chance at getting released.  It wasn’t until my third year in the hole that I felt I had a real chance.  When I was denied that third time, it nearly broke my spirit.  The saying “three strikes and you’re out” echoed in my head as I thought about the men I knew who had been in solitary for over twenty years.  When the counselor finally stepped to my door and told me that I was being released to general population, I was beyond shocked.  I had hoped that I would be released one day, but I had become cynical. \tOn the day I was released from the hole, I did a George Jefferson stroll down the tier and out of the door.  I had made a promise with the other inmates that I would stroll out of the building with that infamous walk perfected by Sherman Hemsley.  It felt good to step out of the building and walk without handcuffs and shackles.  I felt like all eyes were on me as I walked through the compound, but in reality, I was just another brother released from the jail within a jail.   \tOnce I got my typewriter, I went straight to work typing out the books I had written while I was in the hole.  Day after day, I pecked away on my five-year-old wordprocessor.  When I had typed thirteen pages, the memory on my wordprocessor would fill up and I had to print out all of the pages, clear the memory, and start typing again.  It took several days of typing all day to get a manuscript finished.  Despite this painstakingly slow process, I was determined to get it done.  I was in a cell by myself, so I was able to sit for eight hours at a time typing, uninterrupted.   A couple months later, they reduced the prison’s security level to close custody and made us double bunk.  My bunky turned out to be a brother from Lansing who I had heard a lot about.  BX and I were a part of the same brotherhood so we shared a lot of the same views about life.  We ended up getting along like brothers.  In addition to bunking together, we both worked in the law library and worked out together.  BX was serving 52 to 75 years and spent most of his time researching law.  We talked about our sons, and he constantly reminded me why it was important for me to focus on getting out of prison.  The four years that I had left before my earliest release date initially felt like a long time until he told me to take his sentence into consideration.  His words kept me motivated about getting out and using my testimony to make a difference in the community.   \tA few months later, I was transferred to Carson City, and shortly after I arrived, BX showed up.  We laughed about the coincidence and agreed that there was a reason we were relocated to the same joint.  We immediately went to work organizing the brothers and facilitating study groups. The impact of our efforts was felt immediately throughout the compound.   \tCarson City had a notorious reputation as one of the most racist facilities in the state and the tension in the air was thick enough to slice with a prison shank.  The younger inmates were clueless about how to deal with the officers who went out of their way to trample on the few human rights we had left.  BX and I discussed what needed to be done and went to work showing the brothers how to use the grievance system to address whatever issues they had.  Daily, we trained physically and mentally and the younger brothers gravitated to us.  We were doing what had been done for us when we first entered the system as teenagers and felt it was our responsibility to do the same.   \tThat year, we organized a Kwanzaa program, and after a successful turnout, we were invited by the special activities coordinator to organize events for Black History Month.  We convened a small group of brothers that included one of my guys from MR named Larry X.  We agreed to do weekly events, and then do a males rites of passage program.  I reached out to my comrade Yusef Shakur, who had been home a few years, and asked if he could come up to speak with the brothers.  He said he and another brother named Kwasi would come through and support our program.  \tOn the day we were to launch the male rites of passage program, I was filled with excitement. I couldn’t wait to see Yusef as it had been nearly ten years since we’d been at the same prison.  He was the first brother I knew personally to get released from prison and follow through on his promise to be an asset to our community.  When I told Larry X that Yusef was coming up, he got just as excited as I was.  We had all grown up in prison together, sharing books and ideas.   \tWhen I reached the building where our program was to be held, I was met with disappointment.  The activities director informed me that Yusef couldn’t get clearance to return to the prison.  I was pissed because I knew that the younger brothers needed to hear his story; to see that it was possible to get out and do something with your life.  He told me that even though Yusef couldn’t make it, two other members of Helping Our Prisoners Elevate (HOPE) had been approved and would be attending our program.  I knew Kwasi was one, but I had no idea who the other person was.   \tA few minutes later, the special activities director returned to the room with Kwasi and a beautiful sister named Ebony, who I would later learn was also a member of HOPE.  We had exchanged correspondence related to HOPE before, but I had never seen her or spoken to her.  She had beautiful almond-shaped eyes and a positive aura about her that made me smile inside.  I welcomed the two of them into the room and opened up the program.  We had a very candid conversation about what we needed to do in our community and the brothers agreed to be difference makers when they were released.  We then went into a Q & A session before concluding the program.  It was then that I developed an intense attraction to Ebony.  She was very passionate about her views on Black men and their role in the community.  She articulated her points with a fiery intensity that made me think of Assata Shakur, who to me epitomized the strength and resilience of Black women.  I listened to the words that flowed from her mouth as I fought the urge to stare at her and drink in all of her beauty.  I knew I had to tuck away my thoughts for my own sanity and the sake of the program.  Over the years, I had quieted the desire to be in the presence of a beautiful woman, but those desires returned with a vengeance after meeting Ebony.  Despite my deep longings, I refocused on the task at hand.  No matter how beautiful Ebony was, I was unwilling to compromise the integrity of the program or my standing as an organizer.  \tDuring this time, BX had been corresponding with a woman he met through another inmate.  She was very supportive and did her part to help him gain his freedom.  One day while I was on a visit with my family, she came up to visit him.  When my visit concluded, BX came out to the yard and told me that she had a sister who might be interested in corresponding with me.  I told him that I wasn’t interested in another superficial penpal relationship. I had long ago given up on having anyone in my corner other than my father and stepmother.  I had endured years of broken promises and fraudulent correspondence, so I wasn’t interested in going through the emotional roller coaster ride.  Even though I was down to my last four years, I realized that it was still a long time for anyone to wait for me or stand by my side, so I told BX that I had no interest. \tA few days later, he came out to yard and asked me to give her a chance.  I thought about it again and decided to go ahead and write his girl’s sister.  I thought about BX’s situation and the distance his girl had to travel to see him.  I figured the worst-case scenario was that she’d at least have someone to travel with her, so I wrote a letter and gave it to BX to send out.  A week or so went by and I didn’t hear anything back.  I had told BX that it would go down like that, so I retreated back to my writing and focusing on my freedom.   A day or so after my conversation with BX, I was transferred over to level two.  I had never been to level two, so I was a bit excited and nervous at the same time.  I had grown mentally since my short stint at MCF; however, I was apprehensive about dealing with the newer inmates who were coming in fresh off the street and the officers who thought nothing of sabotaging our freedom. \tWhen I arrived in the unit, there was a buzz due to my presence.   There were a few guys in the unit who had either heard of me or knew me from other joints.  They stopped by my cell to see if I needed anything, and I told them that I was okay.  My bunky was a young guy fresh off the street.  We talked briefly as I cleaned up my area.  As we talked, the officers stopped by the cell and dropped off our mail. He called out my name and number, and when I acknowledged, he handed me a small stack of mail.  Most of it was internally generated mail about my transfer to level two, but amidst it was a small envelope with some unfamiliar handwriting. \tWhen I read the name, I realized that it was the lady who BX suggested I write.  Her name was Lauren and she was from Flint, Michigan, a small city north of Detroit.  I could sense from her 8-page letter that she was down to earth and genuinely interested in learning about me as a human.  Once I settled in, I wrote her back and began what turned out to be a great friendship.  She became my comfort as I adjusted to the level two.  We wrote each other nearly everyday and I found a part of my heart softening toward her.  She was very inquisitive, but not in an intrusive way, nurturing and kind.  Whenever we talked on the phone, she always asked if I needed anything and if I was feeling okay.  After a few weeks of exchanging letters, we arranged our first visit. \tI didn’t know what to expect on the visit because it had been some years since I had a visit from anyone other than my family.  I made it to the visiting room first and was assigned a seat where I waited for Lauren to enter the room.  A few moments later, she entered wearing a purple skirt set that looked like it was better suited for a church than a prison visiting room.  We took advantage of the rule that allowed us to hug and kiss briefly at the start of our visit.  It felt good holding her softness in my arms and feeling the warm caress of her lips.  For over a decade and a half, all I had experienced was the hardness and harshness of the cold and indifferent world of prison, so having a little bit of humanity smuggled inside felt amazing.  We spent the rest of the visit getting to know each other and eating processed vending machine food, which tasted like gourmet cuisine compared to what they served in the chow hall.   \tWe agreed that she would come to see me as often as she could.  The more we visited, the more comfortable we got with each other, so much so that we started taking risks like copping illegal feels whenever we could and extending kisses and hugs until the officers said something.  As much as I looked forward to our visits, they were very challenging, however.  It had been years since I touched a woman intimately, and our visits only intensified my hunger for sexual intimacy.  I allowed my hands to roam whenever I could, but it wasn’t enough.  Lauren was also fighting her urges to touch me the way that she wanted to.  The more I thought about what I was missing out on, the more frustrated I became.  Physical intimacy was one of our most basic human urges yet it was discouraged in the visiting room.   When I entered prison, I thought not being able to have sex would drive me insane, but I learned to channel that energy into other things.  There were some, however, who couldn’t channel their energy and turned to homosexuality instead.  My personal view is that these inmates already had those tendencies and prison simply created the platform for them to explore their longings.  Lauren and I had been visiting for a few months when our sexual frustrations came to a head.  We had been sitting on a visit for an hour or so when Lauren began stroking my hand.  I slid my hand over her thighs and stroked them lightly, then caressed one of her breasts with the back of my hand.  We knew the visiting room had a camera and an officer who were constantly on the lookout for any misconduct between couples, but we had gotten away with it in the past so we continued to sneak feels whenever we could.  I placedmy hand back down on my lap (where?) and we continued our visit.  Lauren then put her hand on my lap beneath the arm of the chair and caressed my manhood.  We went back and forth sneaking touches and gropes until the visiting room door slid open. When I saw the sergeant making a beeline toward us, I knew it was over.  He told Lauren to grab her belongings and exit the visiting room.  Sadly, that was the last time I’d see Lauren face-to-face for a couple of years.  Our visits were terminated, and I was written a sexual misconduct for touching her breast with the back of my hand.  That was the beginning of the end of our short-lived romance; however, our friendship remained for some time.  We continued to write each other on and off throughout the remainder of my incarceration, but things were never the same.   \tAbout two weeks later, I was transferred to Riverside Correctional Facility, which was the first joint I had been sent to after I went through quarantine in 1991.  Things were different and it took me a minute to adjust to the prison, which was a bit run down.  I followed a similar routine as I had at previous joints.  I joined the brothers for Kwanzaa and became a member of the National Lifers Association.  Even though I wasn’t serving life, I wanted to use my organizing skills to assist the brothers who were.   \tI had also gotten classified for the Business Computer Technology class and was excited to start.  I knew I needed to learn all that I could about computers in order to pursue my dreams when I came home, so taking the class was a no-brainer for me.  The class was  very interesting because I didn’t know much about computers.  Outside of taking Data Business Processing when I was at MR, I hadn’t been exposed to new technology.  This is one of the great tragedies of being locked up; we were basically being left behind by the world.  In class, we learned the basics, but weren’t allowed to access the Internet so all of the information we were getting was outdated.  It didn’t matter to me though, because it was all new to me and I wanted to do my best regardless of how old the information was.   \tOnce I got settled in, I went to class in the morning and worked out in the evening with the brothers.  When I was in the unit, I spent my time writing and working on ideas for getting my work out there.  I met a brother named Anthony Moorer who was very knowledgeable about urban literature and self-publishing.  He had started a publishing company before returning to the joint and was able to give me a lot of pointers about the book game.  We walked to chow everyday and talked about the future and how we would work together when we were released.   Our conversations kept me inspired and motivated.   While I was at Riverside, I realized how much of the prison experience  I needed to shake out of my system.  I no longer cared about what was going on out on the yard.  My mind was focused on getting out of prison, and the small thinking of some of the guys around me started to really irritate me.  I found myself retreating further into myself more and more.  I understood where the brothers were coming from and empathized with them, but I was tired of prison life and the gossip about what was going on out on the yard.   \tI had been at Riverside for a month or so when my father brought my sisters Nakia and Shamica  up to see me.  It was the first time I had seen them in awhile.  We sat in the visiting room laughing and joking and talking about the future.  It was 2006, and I was down to two years before my earliest release date.  I could sense that my father was getting excited.  It had been a long time coming and we agreed that the worst was behind us.  Having my family visit really meant a lot to me.  Their presence gave me hope and increased my desire to get out and live my life in a way that honored their sacrifices over the years.  My father had stood firmly by my side and I was looking forward to showing him that his efforts hadn’t been in vain. The countdown to my homecoming was underway and I couldn’t have been more excited. \tA few days after my family’s visit, I was sitting on my bunk when the unit officer came by and handed out mail.  I had received a lone letter from Ebony and immediately tossed it on the desk to read later.  I had received HOPE-related letters from her before so I thought nothing of it when I saw her name.  I loved the work that HOPE was doing and was eager to join the organization whenever I was released.  We didn’t have many advocacy groups who represented the interests of inmates.  Without groups like HOPE, the State would continue to silence inmates’ voices and trample on their human rights.   Our unit was first for chow so I decided I would read the letter and find out what HOPE was working on when I returned to my cell.  I waited outside the unit for Anthony and headed to the chow hall.  We talked about the latest trends in the publishing industry and how important it was for us to start our own companies.  His insights always gave me something to think about.  When I first started writing, I had no idea how I would get my stories out.  All I knew was that I wanted to get my work out there and share my art with the world.  The first person to talk to me about the possibility of self-publishing was my older stepbrother Will.  He was someone whose opinion I valued and whose intelligence I respected. When he showed interest in my writing and started helping me work on getting my books published, I knew I was on to something.   \tWhen I got back to the unit from talking to Anthony, I went to my cell and opened Ebony’s letter.  I stared at the letter for a few minutes and re-read it several times before a smile creased my face.  I was expecting to read something about HOPE, but instead there was a short personal letter from Ebony: March 20, 2006 Brother Shaka, I pray this letter finds you in good health and spirits.  I have been meaning to write you for some time, but I am so forgetful (despite my youth!).  I received a letter the other day from Brother Tone that made me go ahead and write.  In his letter, he spoke about the need for conscious female correspondence, and asked me to forward his info to some of the sisters I work with (I work at an African-centered school).  After reading his letter, I thought about you, probably because I met you both at the same time, and wondered if you felt the same.  I assume you have sisters who you correspond with but may also want to kick it with a sister of like mind. Yusef gave me your address.  I hope that’s okay.  I’ve actually never written anyone about anything other than HOPE business.  while I have received countless letters, most of which I didn’t have time to reply to, I am committed to corresponding with you, even if I don’t reply right away.  I’ve gotten so used to the fast-paced world of technology that I usually communicate via e-mail or text messaging… so I will have to slow down a bit so that I can compose a letter. I realize how important correspondence with family, friends, and supporters are to our brothers’ development; this may ultimately make the difference in the choices they make once they return home.  Even still, I’ve been neglectful in writing.  Perhaps because I shoulder much weight as an active member, and now secretary, of HOPE.  But I must admit that it helps knowing you are one of Yusef’s comrades.  That personal connection, although not necessary, makes writing consistently that much easier for someone like me who’s very busy and forgetful to boot.  I also plan to write Yusef’s baba as well. Anyway, I am writing you at work so I must close this letter.  I look forward to building with you. In struggle, Ebony   Though her letter was short and non-committal, I knew I had to seize the moment and let her know exactly where I stood and what I was looking for.  While her offer of friendship was nice, I was at a point in my life where I knew what I wanted and needed.  Prison had hardened me and I knew it was going to take a special woman to help me break through the rest of the bricks that remained around my heart..  There was no doubt in my mind that Ebony possessed the qualities and the determined spirit to do so. \tWhen I sat at my typewriter that evening, I wrote as though she was in my presence and we were having a conversation.  I was as excited as a puppy when I received a response from Ebony a few days later.  Her thought-provoking inquiries and candid responses to my thoughts and questions made me feel special.  I felt like we were sharing more than our thoughts and philosophies on life; it felt like we were sharing the most intimate parts of our souls.  It wasn’t so much the subject, but more-so the depth and ease with which our conversations flowed. We talked about our dreams, visions, fears, setbacks, insecurities, and hopes for the future.  We discussed food security, revolutionary theory, and community activism. \tWhile Ebony has jokingly accused me of putting some serious mack game down on her, it was a mutual feeling.  She had a way with words that touched places inside of me that no one had before.  She caressed my broken spaces with tender poetry and thought-provoking questions and helped me heal by sharing her personal frailties and life triumphs.  Her thoughtfulness was second to none, and I knew she was the kind of woman that I wanted to share my life with.  Ebony was everything I had dreamed and imagined the woman I shared my life with to be.  She was intelligent, compassionate, thoughtful and committed to carrying on the legacy of our people.   \tAfter a few letters, I let Ebony know in no uncertain terms that I wanted to see her in person.   She agreed to a visit, so I went to the counselor to have her added to my visiting list.  Before we could schedule a visit I was told that I was being transferred to another joint.  I knew it was only a matter of time before I was sent to another facility due to my name coming up as being responsible for an inmate getting assaulted over one of my store bags being stole.  The counselor was pissed at me because the inmate was the unit laundry man and store clerk.  When he called me in the office, he told me he knew I had him assaulted but couldn’t prove it. He told me to call the goons off, and I told him I didn’t know what he was talking about so he told me to get out his office.  A couple of weeks later I was transferred to Coldwater where I would finally be able to see Ebony face-to-face since we had started corresponding.  When they called me for a visit I had butterflies in my stomach.  When Ebony entered the visiting room, I took her hand in mine where it fit perfectly.  In the cold, cruel world of prison, I had finally found someone who was capable of loving all of me. Chapter 25 \t \tFor years, the circumstances surrounding my arrest were the focal point of my anger.  Everyone who I thought of as a friend had turned their backs on me.  In my naiveté, I expected them to stay true to the code of the streets.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think anyone would violate the code and make statements against me.  But I was a fool and had been one for a long time.  Each night I hit the block to hustle, I was putting my life in someone else’s hands and giving them the power to determine my future.  Each time I carried a gun under the influence of alcohol, I was rolling the dice and gambling with my future.  My inability to be wise in how I shared my loyalty punched me straight in the throat when the police arrived to arrest me.  The friends I once had became faceless, nameless ghosts that hid in the shadows of my life.   \tIt wasn’t until I matured and evolved in my thinking that I was able to liberate myself from my anger and thoughts of revenge.  I had held people to unrealistic expectations and hadn’t taken into account that we were all kids, and some of us still possessed childhood fears.  We acted hard and indifferent until we found ourselves shoulder deep in trouble, and the charge of accomplice to murder was as deep a trouble as a teenager could get.  My undeveloped emotional side said that they should have remained silent, but I was delusional.  I mean I had just shot and killed another human over a meaningless argument, so what the hell did I know about what was right or wrong.   \tAs much as it pained me to read the statements that were made against me, it hurt even more to know that people I thought of as friends had walked away and turned their backs on me.  Not one person I thought of as a friend stood by my side past my first six months in prison.  They proved the saying out of sight out of mind to be true.  It was the cruel reality of life on the streets; there truly wasn’t any love.   \tI recall my last moments of freedom vividly.  In our haste to get out of Detroit, Brenda and I fled to my sister Vanessa’s house where we stayed the night. We didn’t have any plans beyond the next moment.  We figured we would get some dope and then flee to Ohio; it was something else I hadn’t through all the way through.  All I knew was that I needed to get away from Detroit.  We stayed the night and slept on my sister’s floor waiting for daybreak. \tThe following morning I went and sold the murder weapon and then returned.  We sat at the dining room table discussed buying some dope and leaving when my sister’s boyfriend Smiley returned from an errand. Brenda looked worn down and I was tired and on edge. I knew the clock was ticking and I was anxious to get on the road to anywhere other than Detroit.  I recall thinking about how things would be okay once I got to Ohio.  \tMy sister Vanessa was in the kitchen cooking when her Smiley returned to the house.  We talked briefly about me going to a hotel until we were ready to head out of state.  Before we could finish our conversation we heard a knock at the door.  It felt like everything froze in time and all I remember was the look on my nephew Moota’s face. He looked so innocent and all I wanted to be in that moment was an innocent baby without a care in the world.   \tWhen Smiley opened the front door and I saw the stiff grey blazer the detective wore I knew that my world was about to come to an end one way or another. Smiley had an AK 47 in the back room and I was ready to put it to use.  I had no desire to go to prison and would have rather died then have them put me in handcuffs.  When the detective approached me, I felt my legs tighten up as I prepared to rush to the back room and grab the AK and come out blazing, but I couldn’t move.  I was frozen in place by the look on my nephew’s face and the thoughts of what his life would be like if I made any sudden moves.  Instead, I tried to bluff my way out of being arrested.  Instead of giving the officer my real name, I gave him a childhood friend’s name who lived down the street. We had the exact same birthday down to the year.  As clever as I thought I was the officer was a lot smarter.  When they placed the cuffs on me and ushered me out the door to the car, my entire life flashed before my eyes.  The homicide carmay as well have been a casket because I felt cold and dead inside.  \tAs we rode through the streets of Detroit all I could think about was the fact that I would never cruise those blocks again.  There would be no more shops to the malls, parties, cruise up and down Fenkell and Wyoming, eating what I want or laying up listening to Brenda.  I had just forfeited a chance to do the things I loved or dreamed about.  I had spent many days deep in thought about getting my life in order, returning to school and living a normal teenage life, but it was all too late-I would never be a kid again. \tWhen I reached the homicide division at 1300 Beaubien the officers paraded one statement after another into the interrogation room.  Everyone said something to the police about what they heard or what they saw.  To their credit a few tried to lie for me and did their best to get me out of trouble, but there were others who outright told everything.  I hung my head in shame as the officers read each statement.  I thought about each person and how we had met, and what I would have done if I were in there shoes.  I can’t say what I would have done were I in their shoes under the duress of being charged for a murder they hadn’t committed.  It was no secret in the hood that there were plenty of young brothers in prison serving life sentences because they refused to make a statement even though they hadn’t pulled the trigger. Police were notorious for using scare tactics against young teenagers and it is very intimidating no matter how hard you think you are.  It was this discovery as a man that helped me get over the statements.  It is also a lesson I try to impart to the young brothers and sisters I encounter.  When you live a life of crime there is no such thing as a friend or loyalty.  When it comes down to it they will always put themselves before you.  If the judge asked them whether they wanted to do life in prison or have you do it, they will choose you each time.  It may hurt them inside and destroy a part of them forever, but it will never hurt enough for them to take the option of being sent to the joint. Fact of the matter is the streets are all about self-preservation, and its every person for themselves.  \tThe days of stand up guys are nearly extinct, and there are only a few guys who can say they were thoroughbreds till the end.  Not that its something to be proud of, but since we are fixated on keeping it real and people tend to follow what they perceive as real.  With that being the case or the criteria young guys should follow the guys who go off to college or who start their own businesses because they are the ones keeping it real while the rest of the dudes in the streets keep it real fucked up.   \tWhen you go through each drug king pen’s crew, there was always someone on the inside snitching, and sadly, some of these guys celebrate those guys.  I personally find no glory in the way I lived my life on the streets.  I don’t value the reputation I got on the streets or on the prison yard.  What I do value is what I have learned about life because of my decision-making and how it has helped me help other young brothers and sisters.  To me, the one and only lasting thing that is truly gangsta is intelligence.  You can’t kill it, lock it up, or deny it.  Yes, intelligence is the new gangsta.   Chapter 26 \t When we reached our seats in the visiting room and sat down, I noticed something was different about the Ebony I had met at Carson City.  A scarf replaced the long, flowing locs that at one time adorned her head, and her glowing, unblemished skin was healing from a severe bout of acne.  It was a dramatic change in Ebony’s appearance.  I had an image of her in my head and was surprised that she hadn’t mentioned the acne outbreak during our correspondence.  I didn’t know what to make of it, and for a brief second, I thought about conversations that I had had with other inmates about women dating prisoners.  In prison, it isn’t uncommon for a woman who is going through physical challenges or self-esteem issues to seek out companionship from men in prison.  However, everything about Ebony spoke to her genuine interest.  She asked deep, probing questions and answered my questions with sincerity and honesty. We would later discover the root cause of the outbreak and her face healed completely, returning to its unblemished beauty. \tDespite the change in appearance, Ebony’s warm spirit and deep, soulful eyes remained unchanged. There was a quiet sweetness that emanated from her in a way that endeared me to her immediately.  She had an ease about her that allowed us to flow in and out of conversation with the fluidity of a gentle stream.  \tWe discussed a wide range of subjects about life, love and relationships.  She shared with me her love for urban gardening and how she believed it was necessary for Black people to have control over their own food supply. She explained to me what it meant to have food security.  Her passion was evident and it made me want to learn more about her work in the field.  I shared with her my love of writing and goals for my life after prison.  By the time our visit ended, we had discussed everything from private-owned prisons being sold on the stock market to the abundance of liquor stores, fast food restaurants, and inferior grocery stores that were deeply entrenched in Black neighborhoods. \tEbony’s conversation was refreshing and fed parts of me that had been starved for years.  My mind craved the mental nourishment that she provided and I could sense the feeling was mutual.  When I began my transformation, I often thought about the kind of woman I desired to have in my life.  I was growing as a man and my needs had grown beyond the needs of my youth.  I wanted a woman in my life that challenged me to be the best man I was capable of being. I wanted a woman who would love and nurture my    I needed a woman who had profound understanding of what it would take for me to transition back to the community, and who had a determined spirit.  Not long into our relationship I would learn that Ebony was all of that and more. \tOne of the things I knew was that the Department of Corrections would test the fibers of our relationship in ways that would make us think we were crazy for daring to love.  The system wasn’t designed for inmates to cultivate healthy relationships with people on the outside.  Families of loved ones were discouraged from visiting through various tactics from invasive pat searches to officers talking to them like children.  Then there was the reality of prisons being excessively far from home.  While the majority of prisoners were from Detroit and southern Michigan, the majority of the prisons were in rural areas up north.   \tA few weeks after our first visit, I was transferred from Coldwater to a minimum security prison in Jackson, which was the first time in my incarceration that I had been transferred to a prison less than an hour from home.  Ebony and I were excited when we got the news of my transfer.  I had never been to a level one prison before, but I felt like it was a sign that I was on definitely on my way home.   \tWhen I arrived at Cooper Street in Jackson, I sought out a few brothers to get a rundown of the prison.  They told me it was a transitional prison for the camp system.  I was convinced that they were mistaken, because I didn’t think I met the requirements for the camp system.  However, when I spoke to my counselor, he informed me that I had been approved for transfer into the camp system.  I explained to Ebony that this approval meant that I could be sent to a camp up north. She told me to think positively and focus on staying where I was.  It was true that some of the guys had found ways to stay at Cooper Street until they saw the parole board, so it gave me a glimmer of hope.   \tThe energy at Cooper Street was different from any prison I had been to because inmates were being released every morning.  I ran into a few guys I had done time with at different prisons and it felt good to watch them walk out of prison after having served nearly their entire adult life in prison.  When I ran into one of my guys from the east side name E Love and saw that he was heading home, my confidence in my chances of getting out increased tenfold.  E Love was far from the model prisoner, and if they were letting him go, I figured I stood at least half a chance.   \tOnce I was settled in to the flow of the prison Ebony and I discussed visits and phone calls. At the time phone calls were nearly eight dollars for a fifteen-minute call, so we tried to limit our calls, but it was hard.  Our communication was so good that we never wanted to stop talking, but we did our best. Visits were a great supplement because it allowed us to really connect with each other.  There were days when we spent eight hours sitting and talking to each other.  We played Scrabble, cards and laughed and joked with each other. There were other times when we just held hands silently lost in our own world.  Though the visiting rooms were full because of the prisons close proximity to Detroit, it felt like we were in our own world.  As much as I enjoyed our conversations there were two parts of the visit that I always looked forward to.  \tTaking pictures with Ebony was one of my favorite things about visits.  It provided me with an opportunity to sneak in feels on her booty and get extra kisses, especially when I had a cool cameraman.  Looking back, my antics remind me of a junior high student getting his first kiss.  Whenever I left from our visits, I would kick back on my bunk and play back every detail of our physical contact.  I thought about how Ebony felt in my arms and how sweet her tongue tasted.  No matter how many kisses and feels that I snuck in, however, I was always left wanting more.  It was a sweet form of torture that left me frustrated as I was ready to have all of her as a woman. \tWhen it was time for us to depart from our visit, I was conscious of the officers watching us kiss.  Each officer had a different approach to couples kissing.  Some would give us a minute and others would tell us to stop before we even got started.  Whenever there was an officer that didn’t really care, we took full advantage of it.  The first time it happened, I experienced the deepest sense of fulfillment I had ever had.  It was a sensual experience that had superseded any sexual experience I had had in my life.  When I held Ebony in my arms and kissed her deeply and passionately it felt as though our souls were making love.  There was a feeling of profound love being transmitted by our tongues, lips and hands. I caressed her tenderly and held her tightly.  When I returned to my cube I was on cloud nine.  Though we had other great kisses and experiences of intimacy there was nothing like that moment. \tAfter a few weeks of visits, getting to know each other and laying the foundation for our relationship, I grew comfortable with the idea of staying at Cooper Street.  Inmates who had been transferred in after me had already been sent up north, so I thought I was safe from taking that trip over the bridge.  You can imagine my shock and disappointment when I was told – the day before my birthday – to pack up for a transfer up north.  Our relationship was young and vulnerable, and I knew that we were about to be put to the ultimate test, a test that had destroyed many relationships. \tI still had two years before my earliest release date, and I knew inmates who had been over the bridge for more than two years.  There were several camps over the bridge that ranged from 6 to 12 hours in travel time from Detroit.  It didn’t matter, however; none of the options up north would provide us with the ability to see each other every week the way we had grown accustomed to at Cooper Street. \tI hated making the call to tell Ebony I was being transferred. My fingers felt like lead as I dialed her number.  In the back of my mind, I thought the transfer would be the end of our relationship.  I didn’t want to add any stress to Ebony’s life, and I knew that regular visits made it easier for us to be together.  Now we were being stripped of them.   \tWhen Ebony answered the phone, her bubbly, melodic voice made my heart ball up in a knot.  I knew the news wasn’t going to go over well.  The words slowly crawled out of my mouth like a plump caterpillar inching its way along.  “Baby, they’re transferring me to a camp up north,” I said with a heavy heart.  That was the hardest conversation I had had while in prison.  Part of me was fearful that our relationship was too young to endure the trials and tribulations we were about to face, and the other part of me felt selfish for dragging Ebony into the crazy world of prison.  I wanted to tell her to run to protect her from the madness of a system designed to break wills, crush dreams and annihilate relationships; yet I wanted to love her, cherish her and experience her companionship.  \tWhen Ebony responded, it was through tears, which was heartbreaking to hear.  She told me that she had planned to come up for a visit the following day to celebrate my birthday and sing me a birthday song.  Her voice cracked a couple of times as she shared her plans for my birthday, and all I wanted to do was take her in my arms and hug away the hurt, but I couldn’t.  I felt helpless and vulnerable.  Silently, I cursed the system and the universe for being so cruel.  I mean, how could they attempt to destroy something that was so beautiful and innocent?  Didn’t they see the healing power of love each time Ebony walked into the visiting room?  From the moment she entered my life, she had unknowingly set about tearing down the walls around my heart, and they were attempting to steal that from me.   \tBefore we hung up the phone, Ebony sung me the most beautiful birthday song I had ever heard, the one she had planned to sing on our visit.  Parts of the song were in Kiswahili, and as I listened, I dreamed of us being on the shores of Kenya, wading in the water as she sung to me.  Her voice was sweet and innocent, yet powerful and firm enough that I knew she truly cared about me.  When we finally hung up, an ominous feeling came over me.  I started having doubts about Ebony’s ability to stay by my side.  I mean, nearly everyone who had professed to love me had abandoned me, or weren’t there when I needed them most, with the exception of my father.  She hadn’t known me nearly as long as my family or childhood friends, so what would make her any different?  Slowly, I began breaking up with her in my mind.  I couldn’t afford to be vulnerable to the winds of change that came with being sent far up north.  I had walked on eggshells before, and didn’t like being unable to plant my feed on solid ground.   \tI didn’t know how far or how long I was going to be up north, and that was unsettling.  The following morning, I was transferred six hours away to Camp Manistique.  It was my 34th birthday, and by far one of my worst as I sat stuffed on a prison bus traveling over the infamous Mackinaw Bridge.  I hated every moment of the trip because it symbolized to me the end of the best relationship and friendship I had experienced.   \tAs soon as I could, I called Ebony to tell her where I had landed.  Without hesitation, she told me that she’d be up there that weekend.  I was at a loss for words.  I expected her to say she’d come up at a later date once she had the time and the finances to plan a trip, but she surprised me.  A few days later, just as we were getting excited about the chance to see each other, we were dealt another blow.  I was being transferred again to a secure level one at the other end of the Upper Peninsula.  Camp Manistique was an unsecured level one with minimal staff, and an inmate had recently been killed at another unsecured camp by an inmate who had done a long bid.  The following week, I was transferred to Baraga Maximum Correctional Facility, which had a level one unit.  Baraga was a nine-hour drive from Detroit, and I knew it would be a long time before I saw Ebony again. \tOnly months into our relationship, and we were being tested on every level.  Despite my initial doubts, Ebony proved that she was a woman of substantial tenacity who refused to be defeated by the system.  Within months, she planned a trip to Baraga and drove up to visit me.  She stayed for four days, and we spent every second basking in the glow of each other’s presence.  We agreed that we would weather any storm together; we believed that our love would guide and sustain us.  I had grown accustomed to fighting the system by myself, so it was a major relief to know that I had someone who possessed the fierce determination needed to overcome the obstacles that the system might place in our path, no matter how hard.  Through each battle, Ebony proved that she was a force to be reckoned with.   \tNine months later, I was again transferred to Marquette Branch Prison after getting into a conflict with an officer at Baraga over a job.  The prison was trying to cut down on its budget and started folding two jobs into one and firing some inmates.  When I was told that I would be doing two jobs for one pay, I told the officer that he had to show me in the policy where it was legal for him to force me to work two jobs.  He couldn’t find anything in the policy, so instead, he threatened to write me a misconduct if I refused to do the other job.  Initially, I wasn’t going to do put up all the supplies (what was the job?), but then I thought about how big of a setback it would be to lose 90 days of good time and decrease my chances of getting out of prison.  So I followed the order, then requested to be removed from my initial assignment before filing a grievance for abuse of authority.  I had learned how to fight using my mind instead of my hands, and it was empowering. \tI landed another job working in the library and the officer hated it.  The next thing you know, I was transferred back toward the middle of the Upper Peninsula.  When I arrived at Marquette, the officers immediately placed me in solitary confinement where I remained for seven days, incommunicado.  They claimed that they didn’t feel comfortable with me there because of the assault on staff case that I caught in 1999.  I was angry, hurt and deeply sad. I felt helpless and vulnerable to the whims of prison officials who didn’t give a damn about me or my family! .  I had already done over four years in solitary confinement for that case and hadn’t caught a misconduct in nearly ten years so they had no grounds or reasonable explanation for putting me in the hole.  Really say how that made you feel.  You just say that you were livid. Ebony and no one in my family knew where I was, and I had no way of communicating with them.  The prison staff refused to give me any of my property, I was limited to three showers a week, and I had no outside recreation.  I knew right then that it was the old boy network at work; they didn’t take kindly to me writing a grievance on their partner.   In legal terms, what they did is called double jeopardy, but in prison, we don’t have a right to a fair hearing.  At any given time, the administration could arbitrarily throw us in the hole, and there wasn’t a damn thing we could do about it.  A week later, I was transferred again.  This time, they increased my security level to medium security, and I was right back in the midst of the madness. Being in medium security again felt like a nightmare.  Instead of being in an environment where inmates were going home, I was back in an environment where stabbings and life sentences were the norm. Explain further \tWhen Ebony found out that they had transferred me to a level two, she went to work writing and calling the administration in Lansing.  In the meantime, I was trying my best to dodge the drama on the yard.  The day I arrived, there was a war raging on the yard, and several guys had been stabbed over the course of a few days.  A brother I knew came to me and told me that he had a shank I could use because there was a lot of beef on the yard.  That was the last thing I wanted to hear, and the last thing I needed at that point in my bit.  I told him I was okay and went to my cube.  For the most part, I stayed in my cube working on my third novel Crack Volume 2 , which book? working out or walking the yard with my cousin Chuck who happened to be there too.  It was the first time I had seen him in about sixteen years.  \tIt felt good seeing a family member, but not under those conditions.  We got caught up on the past before he was transferred to another facility, then it was back to business.  Shortly after I arrived, Ebony came up for a visit and we strategized on how to get my security level back down, and hopefully transferred back on the other side of the bridge.   \tWhile we waited for a decision from Lansing about my transfer, I had to take care of a matter that was troubling me.  There was a guy there who had molested my old bunky’s son and his niece.  When he wrote me and told me about it, I knew what had to be done.  I made the arrangements to take care of the guy, but it troubled me.  I was at a point in my life where I was tired of the madness of prison and all the street codes.  I wanted to just move on with my life.  However, my sense of loyalty and thoughts about what I would want done if it were my child was all I needed to act.  It was one of the hardest decisions I had to face because I was growing into a different phase of my life, and I no longer had a desire to adhere to street or prison codes.  However,my former bunky was like a brother to me, and by virtue, his son was like a nephew, so I had to take care of things.  The matter was handled, and a few weeks later, I was transferred to another secure level one in Ojibway, which is located in the Upper Peninsula so far northwest that it’s in the Central Time Zone.   \tOjibway was better known to inmates as O-stab-a-way because of all the stabbings that took place there.  Despite its designation as a level one, it was run like a level two.  A lot of the inmates there had done long stretches in prison, and still had a few more years to go, so they were easily provoked to violence. They had grown up in prison during the era when stabbings and violence was a regular occurrence… (say something about the attitude of inmates who still have a lot time left).  The racial tension between inmates and guards was intense due to a recent riot in response to a White officer who allowed a White inmate to stab a brother.  Adding insult to injury, Ojibway was more than ten hours from Detroit, which meant visits were rare.  \tOnce I settled in, I went to yard to see if there was anyone there I knew.  I ran into one of my guys from the east side named Mo Bounce, and he gave me the rundown on the joint.  We walked the yard and got caught up on what was going on in each other’s lives.  It had been over ten years since we’d been at the same prison, but we had maintained contact through letters.  Mo Bounce had over twenty years in and had been denied parole multiple times.  He told me about the parole process, and we talked about my chances of getting out.  We both knew it was going to be a battle, but I told him that I was going to make it as hard as possible for them to keep me hostage.   \tUnlike most level one facilities, Ojibway had 8-man cubes and cells, and I was lucky to get a cell with one bunky instead of a cube with seven other guys.  I took advantage of the time in the cell and did some writing and studying. Mentally, I was preparing for my future, and the fewer distractions I had, the better.  I called Ebony whenever I could, but it was difficult to talk as much as we wanted or needed because the unit had limited phone access.  Plus, it cost more than $8 for a 15-minute phone call.   Though I was over ten hours away, we did what was necessary to maintain our visits.  Although not ideal, Ebony made that long trek with complete strangers in an effort to share travel expenses.  She trusted me to find a solid brother whose girl was interested in a visit and would be able to split the cost of gas and a few nights in a hotel.  Once I made the connection, Ebony would coordinate everything else.  Within my first seven months at Ojibway, we had three visits, which helped us grow as a couple.  During our visits, we talked about my upcoming parole hearing, we argued, we laughed, and most importantly, we dreamed of our future together.  Instead of allowing the system to break us, we grew stronger and more committed in our love for each other.  Ebony’s letters and our weekly phone calls became my lifeline and inspiration.  On my roughest days, I thought about the dreams we shared and the future we aspired toward, and that kept me grounded. As the months wore on, I started growing anxious.  I was getting closer and closer to seeing the parole board, however, there was a class that I needed and I hadn’t been placed yet.  Even still, we started asking our family, friends and members of the community to write letters to the parole board on my behalf, and I continued working on my business plan.   As my earliest release date grew near, we started sending requests to the prison administration to get into the Assaultive Offender Program (AOP), a group therapy class required for all inmates with an assaultive case.  It was the last of my recommendations that needed to be completed before I saw the parole board, but the waiting list was longer than my arm.  Although I had seen many brothers go to the parole board without completing AOP, I didn’t want to be in their situation.  It was through no fault of their own, and that was the tragedy of it all.  The parole board refused to let anyone go who hadn’t completed the the one-year program yet the state didn’t have enough slots to accommodate the number of inmates that were required to complete AOP.  So Ebony and I went to work trying to get me into AOP, but to no avail.  As the year wound down and it was time for my counselor to do my Parole Eligibility Report, I hadn’t been added to the list to take AOP.  I was concerned, but tried to remain optimistic. \tA few months into 2008, I was added to the list and told I would be taking the class at Ojibway.  I was excited to get the news about AOP because I knew that completing it would be one less excuse the parole board could use to deny my release; however, I dreaded spending another year in Ojibway, ten hours away from Ebony.  Just when I was ready to settle into the idea of taking AOP at Ojibway, the group was cancelled. It was a devastating blow and my only hope was to get transferred to another facility that had a new group starting before I saw the parole board, but it never happened.  Like many of the brothers before me, I was forced to go to the parole board without completing AOP. \tA couple of months before it was time for me to see the parole board, Ebony and I discussed my strategy for the interview.  I knew the changes I had made in my heart and in my life, but I was also conscious of my reputation in prison.  In nineteen years, I had accumulated thirty-six misconducts, caught a case, and spent 7 years total in solitary confinement.  Though my file reflected the rebelliousness of my early prison years, I knew how unforgiving the system would be.   \tEven though my incarceration had been marred by my earlier years, I was still optimistic about my chances of getting out of prison.  I had taken the necessary steps to become an asset to my community instead of a liability.  I knew if I was released that I would go to work immediately mentoring young men and women who were on the path that I took in my youth.  In the two years we had been together, Ebony and I had started Drop A Gem Publishing and released our first novel.  When the state found out about it they sued me for 90% of the proceeds, fortunately I was prepared for their attack and took the necessary steps to prevent them from getting a dime.  We had also helped publish a book through H.O.P.E for children with incarcerated parents.  My writing was being published in other outlets and people were very supportive of my work and efforts.  I had no doubt that I would successfully complete parole if given a chance, and I would make a difference in some young man or woman’s life if I were set free.  It was this spirit that I carried forth as we prepared for the biggest moment of my incarceration. \tEbony garnered a great deal of support from the community and had people write letters to the parole board on my behalf.  Men and women like the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network’s Executive Director Malik Yakini, who was then Executive Director of Nsoroma Institute and owner of Black Star Community Bookstore, where he offered me employment.  Dr. Gloria House wrote and offered transitional assistance, Dr. Ashley Lucas wrote of my transformation and my creative abilities.  Community activist and founder of Pioneers for Peace Weusi Olusola wrote about the importance of the work I planned to do.  My father wrote of the growth he had seen in me over the years along with my sister Nakia and stepbrother Will. There were a few others who wrote on my behalf so I was excited about the support I would have when I was released.   \tIn August 2008, Ebony accompanied my father, stepmother and son Jay on a visit a couple days before my parole hearing.   It had been a few years since I had seen my son because of the distance and I was beyond excited to see the young man he had grown into.  I also missed my father and stepmother because it had been a minute since I had seen them as well.  When they entered the room, they wrapped me in the warmest hugs.  They were the Black family version of a Snuggie, providing me the love and warmth that was needed to survive the cold world of prison. \tOur visit started off cool and relaxed despite the heavy cloud of my parole hearing hanging above our heads. After we settled in, my father began talking about my freedom and what it meant to him and the family.  As he shared his thoughts, my eyes welled up with tears.  I had not cried in the seventeen years of my incarceration, but I could no longer hold back the tears. I felt the overwhelming pressure to free Ebony and my family from the shackles of prison.  It had taken years for me to realize that I was not locked up alone; my incarceration had impacted my family as though they were sitting in a cell with me.  No one goes to prison alone.  Indeed, incarceration impacts the entire family and community.  My father hugged me as I allowed the tears to flow freely.  As the tears ran down my face, it felt like all of the pain and sadness from my incarceration was leaving my body.   It was refreshing to hear my father tell me that no matter what happened with the parole board, they would never leave my side.  I explained to them that the worst-case scenario was a two-year continuation of my prison sentence.  They told me that they were ready to stand by my side no matter what the decision. My family’s words strengthened me and emboldened me with the courage to face the parole board the following morning.  I knew I would have a sleepless night, but it was a night of peaceful contemplation, meditation and prayer.  The time had come for me to come face-to-face with my destiny.   When the officer called me to report to the control center for my parole interview, I took a deep breath, said a last minute prayer, and walked bravely to the control center.  It was time, and I was ready to put prison behind me.  However, the state had other things in mind, things that made me nearly lose my mind. Chapter 27 \t Never in my wildest imagination would I have thought the parole board would treat my father with the utter disrespect displayed by Enid Livingston, the parole board member who conducted my interview.  When I entered the small, cramped room along with my father, an ominous feeling came over me.  Though Livingston wasn’t in the room physically, I could feel her negative energy coming through the monitor where she conducted the interview via teleconference.  Her voice was dry and her expression stoic when she asked me to say my name and inmate number for the record.  When the formalities were done, she asked me why I had murdered a man.  I began explaining the events that led up to the murder, and before I could get a complete sentence out, she lit into me.  She was very combative and blatantly disrespectful.  She wasn’t trying to hear anything I said and cut me off every chance she got.  She didn’t want to hear anything about the man I had evolved into or the things I had accomplished during the last five years of my incarceration.  I did my best to represent my case with integrity and objectivity, but none of it mattered.  When she was finished interviewing me, she asked my father if he had anything to add.  My father started speaking, and within thirty seconds, she cut him off, saying that she had heard enough.  She told me to have a good day and said that I would hear something soon.  She also told me I needed to get into AOP before I was released from prison. \tWhen I walked out of the control center and headed back to the cellblock, I was full of mixed emotions.  Part of me wanted to believe that I had a genuine chance of getting parole, but the more logical side of me knew that I didn’t stand a chance.  I tried to remain optimistic, but the more I thought about Livingston’s brashness, the harder it was to think about things positively.  When Ebony and I talked later that day, I told her how things went and she encouraged me to think positive and stay focused on coming home.  I trusted Ebony with my life, and her words were the comfort that I needed.   \tOver the next few weeks, we contacted Lansing in an effort to get me placed into AOP, but kept getting conflicting information.  Just when I was wearing down, I was told to pack up because I was being transferred to another prison to take AOP.  The following day, I was shipped back downstate to Gus Harrison Correctional Facility in Adrian.  It was south of Detroit but only an hour or so away.  I could barely contain my excitement.  It had been a long two years over the bridge for Ebony and I.  The long drives for her to see me, and the long droughts between visits were finally over.   \tWe still hadn’t received a decision back from the parole board, and I was holding out hope that they would give me a deferral instead of flatly deny me until I finished AOP.  It meant that I would not make it home on my earliest release date, but upon completing the program, I would be immediately considered for release.   \tMy focus was as sharp as an eagle’s eyesight as I looked toward the future.  When I got to Adrian, I spent most of my time in my cube writing and studying things that I knew I would need to know when I was released.  I kept my interactions limited to a few people that I met while there and a few people that I had known over the years.  They were all focused on going home, and I wanted to be around that kind of energy.  I also took advantage of unaccredited classes offered by Project Community and the Prison Creative Arts Project (PCAP), both sponsored by the University of Michigan.  The classes gave me a creative outlet that challenged me as a writer and artist.   \tI was fortunate to meet and develop some genuine friendships that have endured to this day.  I met young men and women like Alex Ochoa, Laura Rosbrow, Chris Rapisarda, and Nicole Hugget who were all student volunteers that came in and did workshops once a week.  We challenged each other as artists, and eventually put on a show for the prison.  That was my first time acting and writing for the stage, and I loved it.  It was also there that I met Dr. Ashley Lucas, who is an incredible writer and theater instructor.  She taught me a lot about acting and sharing my voice in different mediums.  Ashley and the students gave me honest critiques of my work, which boosted my confidence as a writer. \tUnfortunately, the administration terminated our classes for no apparent reason, but I had built such a great relationship with the students that we kept it touch through letters.  They reached out to me via snail mail, and we continued to share our work and life experiences.  They asked deep, probing questions about my life, and I asked them to send me updated information about the free world. It was a mutual exchange of information and experiences that made the last leg of my incarceration more bearable.   \tA month or so after I arrived at Adrian, I received a letter from the parole board indicating that I had been denied parole for another twelve months.  The impersonal letter said that I would be a menace to society, and therefore, could not be released.  When I read their decision, I was crushed, but I refused to give up or give in.  I knew no matter what their decision, I would still have to complete AOP, which consisted of weekly sessions with a psychotherapist for ten months.   \tIt was a let down for Ebony and I, but we felt that the worst was behind us; there was always a chance to be called back early and see the parole board before the twelve month continuation was up.  In the meantime, I focused all of my energy on completing the requirements of AOP.  When we got our date to begin the group, I learned that the therapist who would be facilitating our group was a psych named Mark Skinner. I was a bit nervous because I had heard a lot of negative things about him, namely that he kicked people out of the group for trivial matters, and he held some his racist beliefs.  The last thing I needed was to be kicked out of a group that took forever to get into.   \tOn the first day of the group, I took time to feel out Skinner and realized that he was just a straight shooter.  His biggest thing was taking accountability and taking all excuses off of the table.  It came across brash and insensitive, but he had a point that I agreed with.  I was tired of listening to guys make excuses for their actions.  When I began taking responsibility for the decisions I had made in my past, I learned the difference between excuses and explanations.  Things were going great in the group until one day Skinner told me that he didn’t think they would ever release me from prison.  His statement came out of the blue and it rubbed the other inmates the wrong way.  A few of them jumped to my defense and asked him why he would say such a thing.  He said it was just his personal opinion based on what he had seen happen to other inmates.   \tHis words stung and took me aback.  I was aware of the games that Skinner played to see if he could throw a person off of their center; however, instead of expressing anger, I told him that I was confident I would be released at some point and would do something with my life.  He nodded with a smirk that told me he either didn’t believe me, or he did, but would never admit it. \tOnce I transferred to Adrian, the months began flying by.  Ebony came up for a visit every week, sometimes twice a week.  Despite the parole board’s denial, we continued to plan for the future because we knew there was a strong chance that I would be called back early to see the board again.  In the meantime, we took advantage of each visit.  No matter what the weather was like or what her workweek was like, Ebony came up to see me faithfully. Our bond deepened with each hug, kiss and conversation.  I knew it was taking a lot for her to stick in there, and that increased my desire to be home, sharing life with her.   One visit we’ll never forget was the day Ebony came to see me in the middle of a snowstorm.  Neither of us knew that the weather would get as bad as it did, or that the backroads leading to the prison would not be plowed until late in the evening.  About twenty miles outside of the prison, she got stuck in a ditch on the side of the road.  Although she managed to get her car out of the ditch, a few more yards down the road, her car got stuck again.  Stuck in the middle of nowhere with no cell phone reception, it took about 15 minutes before someone stopped to help her. \tWhen Ebony came into the visiting room, she was visibly shaken, and I felt like a piece of shit.  I was tired of seeing her suffer for our love, but there was nothing I could do.  Though we never said anything about it, we knew that they could continue to deny my parole until I had served my entire forty-year sentence.  We tried to remain optimistic and continued preparing for life after prison.  As AOP began winding down, I started feeling better about my chances for release.  When they called me back for an early parole consideration, I just knew that I was going to be released.  I was given a date of May 20, which was my father’s birthday and me and Ebony’s anniversary.  The symbolic date was confirmation that things were lining up in the universe for my release.   \tWe researched the parole board member – a woman – who would be interviewing me.  From what we learned, she was very fair across the board so I expected to have a better hearing then the first one  The weather that day was perfect, which we saw as another good sign of things to come.  When I entered the room with my father, the energy was different from the first hearing.  We went through the preliminaries before we got down to business talking about my past.  I started off using the language I had learned in AOP like thinking errors and empathetic role playing…, and she stopped me mid-sentence.  She told me that she understood AOP, but wanted to know what was going on in my mind as a nineteen-year-old with a pistol.  She was sincere and wanted me to give her the real story. \tI told her how I felt after I got shot at the age of seventeen and how I reacted to that experience by carrying a gun everyday.  I let her know how deeply sorry I was for taking my victim’s life and what my plans were for the future.  I showed her the work I had been doing to help other inmates, and the work I had done to prepare for life after prison.  She said she was impressed and had yet to encounter an inmate who was as prepared for life after prison as I was.  She said she admired me for my honesty and ability to take responsibility for my actions.  As we wrapped up, she said I would hear something from the board in the next few weeks.   \tWhen I left the interview, I was on cloud nine.  I felt like I had a great chance of getting out and couldn’t wait to talk to Ebony so that I could share the good news.   Ebony came up to see me that afternoon and we basked in the good news as though we already had our decision in hand.  Over the next few weeks, we started planning my homecoming and discussing things that we needed to do.  First on our agenda was finding me employment considering the bookstore where I had planned to work was forced to close.  We talked about my needs in terms of clothing and the paperwork needed to get an ID.  We were so ready to experience the world of normal living that we could taste it.   Whenever Ebony came to see me, there was a glow to her that I hadn’t seen in a while.  Her radiant glow lit the room – and my heart – up when she entered the building.  She was truly my joy, my rock and I wanted nothing more than to make her the happiest woman in the world.  \tI spoke to my counselor weekly to see if she had gotten word from the parole board.  She also believed that I would be released.  The state was in a budget crunch, and she said they had to start letting more guys go home.  The way she saw it, how could they deny me considering how much I had accomplished and how prepared I was.  All of the positive energy coming my way had me way more excited than I was comfortable with.  I couldn’t sleep, and when the yard was open, I walked the track non-stop with my homeboy Terry who was also preparing to go home.  We talked about what we would do when we were released.  I couldn’t wait to get out and sell books and talk to young men and women who were living on the edge and needed a lifeline.   \tAbout a month or so after I had seen the board, my counselor came to my cube and said she needed to speak with me when count cleared.  The expression on her face told me that something was wrong.  She was normally upbeat and cheerful, but her expression held a sadness that I hadn’t seen before.  I immediately thought of my father as he had been through a few recent surgeries.  I couldn’t imagine life without him, so I prayed that there wasn’t anything wrong at home.  When count cleared, I walked slowly to the counselor’s office with all kinds of thoughts racing through my head.   \tAs soon as I stepped into her office, she looked up at me and delivered the words that threatened to destroy my sanity.  “They denied your release again,” she said softly. I couldn’t believe the words coming out of her mouth.  I had done everything I could, and they had shot me down again.  At that point, Skinner’s comment began bouncing around in my head like jumping beans.  “They’re never going to let you out,” his words said, mocking me.  As I thought about that possibility, the anger began boiling up inside of me.  I was so pissed and hurt that I didn’t know what to do.  I wanted to curl up and die because I knew how devastating the news would be to my family. I was tired of seeing them get their hopes up only to have them dashed, so I decided right there in that moment that I wasn’t going to see the parole board again.  I could no longer be a tool in the destruction and devastation of my family. \t \tShortly thereafter, the unit was being called for chow, but I didn’t have an appetite.  The thought of the smell of the chow hall made me nauseous. I was tired of everything about prison and felt like I couldn’t take another day without going completely crazy.  I felt like I was nearing my breaking point when I picked up the phone and called Ebony.  \tThe sound of Ebony’s voice coming through the receiver nearly caused my knees to buckle.  I told her about their decision and she told me that she was on her way up to see me.  In my head, it felt like it was going to be our last visit. I couldn’t see her going through another year of torture.  Besides, I had always dealt with my incarceration best when I felt like it was just me with my back against the wall.  Though I was tired of life in prison, I had been inside long enough to know that I could do the entire forty years if I had to, but I couldn’t do another year knowing that her happiness was hinging on me coming home so that we could pursue our dreams.  Ebony wanted a family of her own, and I wanted her to have that, even if it didn’t include me. \tAs I took my shower, I thought about what I would say to break up with Ebony.  She had invested her everything into our relationship, which made it even harder to break up with her.  However, I knew she deserved to have a man who was free to share life with her fully, without restrictions.  Yes, Ebony deserved to have a partner who could hold her at night, kiss her in the morning, take her out to nice restaurants, and dance with her whenever the mood struck.  She was worthy of having a man to be a father to her children, who would be there to put toys together, fix bikes and do the things that fathers did, but I could give her none of these things.  \tI sat silently in the visiting room waiting for her to enter.  I replayed what I would say to her in my head, and made peace with my decision. It had been an incredible experience loving and being loved by her, but my heart would no longer allow me to carry on.  She deserved to be free even if I wasn’t. \tWhen I looked up, Ebony was standing on the other side of the security doors being processed into the visiting room.  As she entered the room, I could feel the tears bubbling to the surface, and as soon as she reached me and took me into her embrace, I broke down.  Tears poured from my eyes as we held hands and I talked through sobs of despair.  As much as I hated to admit it, the system was winning.  It was taking away the love of my life and I was devastated.  I looked Ebony in her eyes and told her that I could no longer allow her to suffer alongside me.  She held my hand and stroked it tenderly as I poured out my soul to her.  She wiped away my tears and listened intently as I told her that I wasn’t going to the parole board again because I refused to play their game.  When I finished venting, Ebony looked me in my eyes and told me that there was no way in hell I was giving up and letting them win.  She reminded me that we were “in it to win it,” and she would never give up on me.  No, giving up or giving in was not an option.   \tShe reminded me of everything we had gone through, and how we had overcome every obstacle placed in our path.  She reminded me of how strong my spirit was to have endured 4 1/2 years in solitary confinement and how I had done the hard emotional work that others ran from.  Her words emboldened me with a surge of strength that made me feel as if I could physically lift the prison with one hand and leave at will.  Her reminders of what I was made of gave me the boost that I needed to fight like hell for a freedom I had earned.  For the rest of the visit, we strategized and planned our next steps.  In my weakest moment, Ebony was there to lift me up and I knew then that our bond was unbreakable. \tA few months later, I was transferred back to  Cooper Street in Jackson.  I had completed AOP and was afraid that they were about to send me back up north, but when I spoke to the counselor, she told me that she had no idea why they had sent me there.  One thing she was sure of, they weren’t going to send me back up north to a camp.  It was a relief, but there was still a great deal of uncertainty.  I figured it was best for me to settle into a routine and continue to work on my plans for release. \tI spent my days working out with my brother-in-law Smiley and my guy Derek Ford.  They were positive lights and told me that they believed I would be getting called back early and finally released from prison.   Their words were comforting and it felt good being around men who knew me.  I shared with them the books I had written and they told me how much they loved them and were proud of me.   \tEbony and I spent as much time as we could on visits and the telephone dreaming of our future together.  We agreed to speak into existence what we wanted and keep our thoughts on the positive experiences we would have when I was released.  We created vision boards that included a picture of her and I in front of our home.  She even went out and shopped for my coming home outfit and started preparing the house for my homecoming.  It felt good being in tune with someone who believed in all of who I was.   \tA few months later, I was called back early to see the parole board for the third time.  It had been nearly two years since that first interview with Livingston and I felt like this was the shot I had been waiting for.  Once again, my father accompanied me to the board, and this time, the parole board member who interviewed me was an older Black man who was known to be tough and no nonsense.  After the preliminaries, he asked me what I would do if I were released.  I felt like I was giving the speech of my life.  I told him of my plans as a writer and mentor and how much support I had in the community.  He probed to see if he could punch holes in my plans, but there was none.  The things I planned to do had nothing to do with getting out of prison.  I had plans to right the wrongs of my past. \tWithin a few weeks, I was informed that I had received my parole and would be getting transferred to a prison in Detroit for a re-entry program.  I called my father and he rejoiced with the good news.  When I talked to Ebony, I could feel her smile beaming through the phone. We had done it, and now it was time for us to experience the true joys of being at one with your soulmate.  When I finally got the paperwork in my hand, I couldn’t believe it and slept that night with it in my hand.  I looked at it everyday until I was transferred to Mound Correctional Facility, one of two prisons in Detroit, for the last sixty days of my incarceration. \tI spent those last sixty days working out, reading, and talking to or visiting with Ebony.  We were so excited that we smiled for the entire visit when she came to see me.  Our love had endured four years of ups and downs and it was finally time for us to share life as a man and woman should.   On June 21, 2010, Ebony came to visit me for the last time inside of a prison facility.  It was my 38th birthday, and the following day I would walk out of prison after serving 19 years in prison.   When I inhaled my first free breath, it was like a baby taking in air for the first time.  The free air tickled my lungs and caused me to smile from deep within.  I was officially a free man, and this time, I planned to do it the right way."}

For a thirteen-­year-­old basketball nut, it was nirvana. The game itself was one thing. Jordan, all swagger, his wristband pulled up to his forearm, the way he looked over his shoulder at the basket as he jogged back on defense—­he dropped 63 points on Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 11 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fxii Introduction the Celtics, and still the Bulls lost. But what really caught my eye, and what caused me excitement and agony in equal measure, was those shoes: those red, white, and black Air Jordans. Excitement because surely that was where Jordan’s magic resided, right? I mean, a pair of Jordans would give any player extra lift, extra power, extra speed. But agony, too, because of what had happened to me a year earlier. In April 1985, as my seventh-­grade year was winding down, the first Air Jordans dropped—­but it was also the time when my parents were preparing to separate for the second time. They told me I was going to live with my dad and my uncle ION T Charles on Yacama Road, on the east side of Detroit. Once IBU R T there, I was fortunate enough DIS to make friends quickly, and as R O Faround, the summer came I found my place among the boys on OT N the block. It was a dope summer. We hung out, rode our bikes, played ball—­we didn’t have a care in the world. But there N were clouds forming. Come late August, I would TIObe heading U B to a new school in a new neighborhood.

I should be ready, I was told, to defend our hood. The only thing that got me through the fear was a back-­ to-­school shopping trip my father had promised me. I wanted one thing: a new pair of Air Jordans. They cost twice as much as any pair of shoes I had ever owned, but my heart was set on a pair. My dad didn’t seem to get my hints—­instead of heading to the Eastland Center, where I knew there were some Air Jordans at the Foot Locker, he drove us to JCPenney in Highland Park. There were no Air Jordans there. Instead, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 12 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fIntroduction xiii he made me try on a pair of canvas Air Force 1s, and when they fit, he bought them, and we trudged back to the car. I was devastated. I wasn’t devastated for long; about a week before school started, he arrived home one day with a Foot Locker bag. Inside, sure enough, was a pair of Air Jordans. Though they weren’t the exact ones I’d wanted (seriously, thirteen-­year-­ olds!), I was still ecstatic and couldn’t wait to stride into Nolan Middle School with my Jordans on my feet.

At the end of the class there was a large crease across the toe that could never be undone and scuff marks all over the sneakers. I had broken the cardinal rule of sneaker ownership: They were not, in fact, athletic shoes. They were to be worn for style and style only. Since I knew that there was no way of resurrecting the shoes to their pristine glory, I doubled down: I continued to play basketball in them both at school and at home. One day, after I came inside from playing, my dad looked Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 13 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fxiv Introduction down at the shoes and asked me if they were the same Air Jordans that he had just spent his hard-­earned money on. The shame hit me; I lowered my head and mumbled yes; he shook his head and walked away. He didn’t yell at me or tell me to go to my room. It was worse: I could sense his disappointment, and for days afterward he barely spoke to me. He finally broke the silence one day when I got back from school. “I got you a pair of gym shoes,” he said. “They’re in your bedroom.” Imagine my horror at finding a Payless bag on my bed and inside a pair of Pro Wing high-­top knock-­off Jordans. Instead of soft, high-­quality leather, they were made ION T U plastic, too, guaranteed of hard, cheap plastic. The solesIB were R T S gym floor. I raced down the hallto make me slide all over DIthe R O my dad that I would never wear those Ftold way in tears and OT N shoes. He just said, “Until you become more responsible and take care of the things I provide that’s all you’re going to get.” N That was the beginning of a protractedIO T war of wills U B between us. I tossed the shoes into the TRI closet, and for the S I D rest of the school year I wore R a mixture of older sneakers and O F T the Jordans because he NO refused to buy me anything else and I was not wearing the Pro Wings. Later that summer, my dad, my uncle, my cousin, two younger sisters, and I went to visit my grandfather in Mississippi. Dad forced me to take the Pro Wings, telling me in no uncertain terms that those were the shoes I’d be wearing; I also thought to pack a pair of beaten-­up Nikes. After two sweltering weeks in the mosquito-­infested heat of Mississippi, my dad returned to Detroit, leaving us to stay down in the country with our grandfather for a few more weeks. When I got back to Detroit, my dad noticed that I was wearing the Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 14 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fIntroduction xv Nikes and asked me where the Pro Wings were. I feigned shock and said I’d I accidentally left them down in Mississippi. I think I caught him stifling a laugh at that obvious lie. I realize now that he was desperate to teach me the value of things, while I just wanted to fill the void of my broken home life with the approval of friends. Somewhere in between was where our love lay. The next few years were traumatic for me, and I would eventually go to prison at the age of nineteen. It wouldn’t be until years later that my dad and I worked to unpack all of the things that had led up to my incarceration, and we did ION T so through the letters we exchanged IBU during the nearly two R T IS the moment I was taken to the decades I was in prison.DFrom R FOmy release, my dad and I wrote hundreds county jail upTuntil O N of letters back and forth, discussing the challenges of fatherhood, what it means to be a son and a man, the difficulties N and joys of being Black in America, of learning TIOto heal and U be emotionally present to one another.RIB STfathers of incarcerated DIthe The harrowing ordeal faced by R FO On September 13, 1994, my dad Ttold. people is a story seldom O N wrote, “For me waking up each day and not being able to call you or just see you once in a while is very painful. Sometimes I just sit and cry because I miss you so much.” Yet in those letters, he loved on me, debated with me, challenged me, and explained his life to me; in turn, I sent him love and answered his challenges and tried to make sense of my own life. His words gave me a source of protection and love and the building blocks of manhood when I needed them most, in those pain-­filled, traumatic years of my incarceration. The level of intimacy generated by those letters is something I’m Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 15 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fxvi Introduction coming to fully understand only now as I approach my fifties. I am incredibly lucky to have a father so open to love and to honesty, and it’s these two attributes I’ve tried to pay forward to my own sons in this book. I believe that letters are one of the most intimate forms of communication. They give us an insight into the most frightening, uncertain places and can serve as an introduction to what it means to be passionate, to love, to dream, to settle differences. I devoured books of letters in prison and continue to be inspired by them: those by W.E.B. Du Bois; Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail”; the ION T U letters of George Jackson; Nelson prison letters; the IBMandela’s R T letters of James Baldwin, DISMaya Angelou, Alice Walker, Toni R FO Morrison, andTTa-­ Nehisi Coates. Across the centuries, letters O N have served to challenge ideas, create movements, highlight contradictions, and inspire love. N And they have always tended to reveal the deepest TIO feelings U B of their writer. I remember one I sent toRmy T I dad from solitary, S I D with his life because I felt in which I urged him to move on OR F T I’d never get out of prison. NO His answer was a simple one: “I’ll never leave your side.” Those words kept me alive. The pile of his letters that now sits in my office here in my house in Los Angeles is a testament to his always being there no matter what was happening in my life. Each envelope with my name and prison number etched in my dad’s writing moved me closer to my destination as a father. I am the proud father of two sons, Jay and Sekou. Jay lives in Detroit; he was born in 1992, while I was incarcerated. Sekou is nine years old. He lives in Los Angeles, half the time with his mother and half the time with me. My sons are the Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 16 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fIntroduction xvii hope of the world. I see in them so many things that I was not at their age—­they embody hope and joy and love. I’ve written this book with the intent of doing for them what my father did for me all those years ago: filling them in on my life, on my dreams for them, and on what I wish I’d gotten right through the years. But I also hope to reach boys and young men across America and their parents, especially their fathers. For so long, the voice of fathers has been limited to discipline and toughness; rarely do we get to speak honestly about our own fears and mistakes or explore the deeper, softer emotions that are crucial to effective fatherhood. So when I ION T U just to them but to sons speak to my sons, I’m speakingIB not R T IS everywhere and to theirDfathers. Without sharing our deepest R FO emotions, we T will remain unable to fully connect or talk out O N the pain into a place of love. The basis of all these letters is love. They are an invitation N to love more passionately, more completely, and TIOmore truly U B than ever before. Only with that loveRcan T I we find a way out S I D of dread so many of us of the violence, hardship, and sense OR F T is that this book of letters might have experienced.

TheTresponsibility is profound: children don’t O N choose to be brought onto this spinning planet, and though we hope that each new life comes from N a place of love and care, too often a childIO T is a by-­ U B product of carelessness or selfishness. TRI You don’t get S I D moment of birth, or to choose your parents, Ryour O F even somethingOasT simple and important as your N name. These are privileges a parent should carry out with care and compassion; it’s not a light and airy thing, being a parent. Or at least it shouldn’t be. So here, Jay, I call you “son,” “my son.” But too often I feel like a fraud when I use this word to describe you. I feel like a fraud because I have not been a good father. I have not worn the mantle of being your parent with due care. I have not lived up to the privilege of your existence. I have not walked beside you in the ways I know you have needed. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 3 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f4 shaka senghor In fact—­and it devastates me to say this—­there are days when I don’t feel like your father at all. Those words burn a hole in me, and I wish I would never even bring them to mind, much less write them. But I have done so, and I must bear the weight of those words here, now, forever. Some days I’m convinced that we were closer when I was in prison, but prison has a way of skewing all things—­the brutality all around you, the sense that your humanity is somehow on hold or contingent upon others. I now realize that the memory of our being closer while I was inside was one of the illusions I had about being a father. I thought the ION T letters we exchanged, the irregular IBUvisits, and the few yearly R T IS bridges to keep us connected phone calls were solid D enough R FO But what were they really, compared to until I was released. OT N the days—­years’ worth of them—­when I was absent? Have you ever seen the film of the Tacoma Narrows N State Bridge? It was a suspension bridge up in Washington TIO U B that couldn’t handle the wind. It swayed TRIoften and eventually S I D buckled and fell into the Puget Sound. That was what it was OR F T like to base my hopesOfor N us on those letters, calls, and visits: eventually, things were going to collapse under the pressure of the air. I now realize how wrong I was, how impossible it is to forge bonds of familiarity under the oppressive weight of a prison sentence. I was so bent on trying to connect with you and guide you down a different path that I didn’t stop to think about the path you were forging on your own on the other side of the bars. How could I have done so? Being a parent is complicated, in or out of prison. But in prison? Impossible, perhaps. Add to all this, as it must always be added: you were a Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 4 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 5 Black boy. Childhood for anyone is a burden. (I have no idea where the idea that childhood should be carefree comes from.) And being a Black child is harder. We are burdened with a lack of overt affection, and we are not invited to try out the world as innocents. From the start, the world treats us like little men and women; we are told to suck it up, to be tough, that emotion is weakness, that the cold world is coming for us so we’d better be ready. Still, you were so innocent once—­a little boy I wanted to protect from all the terrible things that young Black boys face. So many terrible things, things that an innocent child couldn’t conceive of—­ was I supposed to ION T tell you all of them so that youIcould BU avoid them? Was I supR T IS like Moses in the rushes?

Our first visit was at the Michigan Reformatory in Ionia, Michigan. It was the fall of 1993; you were twenty-one months old. I had never met you, never held you, never been woken in the small hours to save you from nightmares. To that point in your life I had only ever seen photos of you, the ones that your grandfather sent along with his letters. My father would Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 5 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f6 shaka senghor fill me in on your personality and write that you reminded him so much of me. That must have been so painful for him, me incarcerated and his grandson reminding him with every coo and first word that his own son was gone. But I took great comfort from those letters, because I knew my father was doing his best to take care of you, to create a connection between his son and his grandson, even though we were miles apart and separated by the mandate of the state. Imagine, then, the day that my name was called: I had a visitor. I was shocked. It had been so long since someone had come to see me; so long, in fact, that I had blocked out the ION T expectation of seeing anyone. IThat BU was how I coped; I low R T blocked any thoughtsDofISfamily or affection or connection OR with the outside T F world. I was like a tackle aiming for the O N knees, bringing down any hope so that it couldn’t get past me, couldn’t hurt me, couldn’t make my prison life any more N depressing than it already was. TIO U B So imagine again: As I reached the visiting TRI room, my hands S I D bolts of sweat dripping began to shake, and there were great OR F T down my sides. HereO N was hope, getting by my defenses, causing me to tremble and sway like a poorly built bridge. The hope was this: I was finally going to see the son I had heard so much about. And there you were, just twenty-one months old, a beautiful brown ball of curiosity and energy. I watched my dad carry you in, and it reminded me of the way he would carry my sisters and put them to bed. But my excitement at seeing you soon turned to heartbreak when I reached your way and you wouldn’t allow me to pick you up. I had created a narrative about our close bond, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 6 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 7 but your reality was that I hadn’t been in your life and you had no clue who I was. I had missed all of the bonding moments that take place between children and their fathers. I hadn’t wiped away your tears, hadn’t held a bottle to your lips in the middle of the night, hadn’t changed your diaper. All I had been was a name, the word “father” without the meaning behind it. I had been a ghost. You didn’t want me, and I was crushed. When I tried holding you, you cried so hard, and the echo of that cry haunted me for days after our visit. Your tears woke me up out of my ION T sleep, clawing at me, monstersIeach BU one—­no longer beyond R T S ripping at my sanity. “He will the trees but now in my DIcell, R FOas the bogeyman,” my mind said, “or even grow up seeingTyou O N worse, the invisible man.” Those thoughts took the blood out of my body, left me weak. N For days, I was of no use. I would lie on my TIObunk, held U B down by the gravity of those thoughts. TRIIt was the weight of S I Dfor you, that I had forfeited realizing that I hadn’t been there OR F T my right to be your father. NO Each time my cell door slammed, I stewed in the knowledge of my failure, of how wrong it was to call you “son,” and how much I longed to do so. The Michigan Reformatory is nearly three hours from Detroit. Your grandfather couldn’t afford to bring you as often as he would have liked or as often as I wanted. Even when you came, the rules were so restrictive that they made it almost impossible to bond organically. I couldn’t sit you on my lap or tousle your hair. These simple things, these simple acts of affection and love, are available to other fathers and Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 7 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f8 shaka senghor sons everywhere except here. And it was clear that you were in pain, too. You couldn’t take me home with you, away from that place, and you cried every time you had to leave. As you got older, I realized that I would have to make you grow up fast, faster than children in less trying circumstances. (Now I realize that this isn’t only what happens to the children of incarcerated parents; being a child generally ends early for Black boys.) I had made choices; because of those choices, I had saddled you with a great daily burden. All parents do this to some degree—­remember, no child chooses to be born—­but I had added to this cosmic truth a layer ION T U that had led me to this of pain from my decisions, theIB ones R T prison. Now, every time DIISsaw you, I had to remind you that R FOmy hair or rub my beard—­rules designed you couldn’t touch OT N to “protect children” when really, they just added pain upon pain. Those of us in prison had no power to change those N rules; our children had to see us shorn of all agency. TIO It was a U B perversion of the norm; parents protect TRI their children from S I DThere the parent is without feeling helpless, but not in prison. OR F T power, and the childO N sees. On some visits you just sat across from me and stared. I would ask you what you were thinking, and you always said, “Nothing, Daddy.” But I knew there was something—­the tears that glistened at the corner of your eyes revealed that something, a thing so powerful, so damaging, that I was grateful you were unable to put it into words. You sensed that, I think, and held back. But the something was this: Because of my choices, you were locked up, too. Your innocence was held hostage right alongside mine. For nineteen years I tried to be a father to you, to ensure that we stayed connected and you knew you were loved. I Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 8 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 9 owed you a father, and I did what I could to give you what you deserved. But it was never enough; it could never be enough. Jay, I thought about you every day in there. I would lie on my bunk wondering what your life was like on the outside. I imagined you playing ball and running through the neighborhood like other kids. I pictured you going to amusement parks and going to prom and all the things that make up a childhood. I so desperately wanted for you to be free to be a child, to maintain the innocence of boyhood, even though I sensed at the edge of my vision that your maintaining your innocence ION T was impossible. So many young IBUmen from our family had R T IS violence and prison sentences. I walked the pathway ofDgun R FO that chain, break that cycle, and live a wanted you toTbreak O N truly innocent life.

Some of my OR F T beautiful relationships NO with their children, and it gave me hope. When I went home, I would teach you all the things I knew and learn all that you knew. We would ride off into the sunset, father and son together. You were eighteen when I walked out of prison and had every right to decide whether I was going to be a part of your life. But me? I wasn’t prepared for anything other than that dreamlike vision of my homecoming. I thought my role was to save you from all the things that destroy Black boys and men, all the things that had destroyed me. So I engaged you in the ways I engaged the other young men I mentored. I made Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 9 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f10 shaka senghor suggestions on how you should dress; pressed you to fill out job applications; challenged you to read books; urged you to avoid hanging around with the wrong crowd; and above all pushed you to chase a dream for yourself, a dream I didn’t even know if you had. I showed up as a mentor, not a father. You needed a father. That was my blindness, the blurry vision of a man newly born into freedom. I’m truly sorry that I didn’t possess the wisdom or thoughtfulness to figure out what you wanted or needed from me. ION UT There were whispers What did I find of you when I got Bhome?

Your first birthday after my release, for example: how badly I wanted to make that day special for you. I couldn’t wait to take you shopping and treat you to a day on the town. I thought that day was going to be our big breakthrough, when in fact it was probably the beginning of the end. From that moment on, it felt as though everything between us was Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 10 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 11 transactional—­that the only value you saw in me was my ability to give you money and things. Some days that’s how it felt. Stuff was our currency, not love. When your name popped up on my phone, I started to assume that you were calling me only for cash. Our relationship had been cheapened, reduced to thirty-­dollar transactions, so I began to withdraw. I started sending you to voicemail.

When you threatened me with violence, I was trigNO gered into the deeply buried ghosts of my life on the streets. I had been beaten; I had been shot; I had killed. I knew in my mind that I was no longer in prison or on the streets, but I didn’t feel it, not yet—­instead, I felt that familiar adrenaline, the chemicals that raged when someone disrespected me. It was a kind of madness, that anger. I could taste it, like blood in the mouth; it would take years to erase that taste, but back then, in my earliest days of freedom, I reacted as though I were still a captive. And you were captive with me. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 11 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f12 shaka senghor I called your grandfather and my best friends, Calvin and Fame, and told them what you had said. They tried to talk me down. You were just frustrated, they said, not processing your feelings in a healthy way. I listened, but I didn’t feel them. So there was only one recourse: one of us had to go. That was the trauma America had visited upon us, upon an entire generation of Black men. We coil tight like springs, inching toward oblivion with every slur we face, every confrontation. We didn’t choose this way; it was etched on our faces like tattoos.

I pictured your face, Jay, searching for the little boy that I had grown to love over the years, and, perhaps, searching in that face for my own innocent face. Could I find it? It was a practice I had learned in prison to defuse conflict, but the exercise was failing; the triggers were intoxicating. My ego had been sliced in a way that I hadn’t experienced in nearly two decades. If I followed through with that thought—­“One of us has to go”—­I would end up back in prison, forever this time. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 12 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 13 I decided to call your mother. Somewhere deep down I knew I wanted her to talk me off that terrible ledge. She knew the street side of me, and she understood you. Maybe she would have the words I needed to hear. She picked up, and before she could even say hi, I started yelling into the phone, “I’m going to put Jay in the trunk of a car and take him to Brightmo’ and leave him over there fucked up! I’m tired of him disrespecting me and talking shit like I won’t fuck him up! It’s time for him to learn that I am not to be played with!” Your mother pleaded with me not to N hurt you, but I was IO T U hands of a man who had filled with anger.

And his father had been replaced by a man of prison, of the streets, saying “One of us has to go.” Still angry, I drove over to your neighborhood, looking for you. When I couldn’t find you, I drove and drove and drove until I calmed down; then I turned my car toward home, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 13 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f14 shaka senghor where I eventually fell asleep. Waking in darkness, I couldn’t imagine where it all would end. A week later, I was pulling into my driveway when I got a call from your uncle Smiley. Uncle Smiley was crying. “Bro,” he sobbed, “they killed Jay, they found his body over in Brightmo’. They kidnapped him from the gas station and took him over there and shot him.” The world ended there, as I sat in my car. My son was now dead.

N But why was I even considering driving anywhere, with a river of tears pouring down my face? Detroit has to be tired of consuming its young. That was the mantra I breathed as Jerry, a friend of mine, drove me to the gas station, the place where he said you had been kidnapped. The city flew by in a blur as we drove by block after block of burnt-­out houses and buildings. Detroit has to be tired of consuming its young. When we got to the station, I could see through the windows that a group of people had gathered inside, all of them Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 14 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 15 waiting silently. I assumed they were your friends. I could see nothing in front of me; I was like a newborn with no vision. I approached someone—­was it the owner of the station?—­and told him I was your father. He just shook his head and said he was sorry about what had happened to you. I asked him if he had a tape from his security cameras, but he told me the police had already retrieved it and that I had to go down to the precinct. As I looked around the room, my eyes started to clear. None of the people looked familiar, and I realized that there were so many elements of your life that I knew nothing about, ION T U they looked like. They including who your friends were, IBwhat R T IS hustle at the gas station; that talked about you, howDyou’d R FOwhat I knew of you. Smiley wrapped his made sense, given OT N arm around my shoulder, and I sank into him.

He said she fed you and TRI that you took care S I D of her yard. OR F T That made no sense. NO You were making money working at your grandmother Marie’s resale shop and didn’t need to be doing any landscaping. Now I was confused and even more scared. I didn’t know what to do next, so I went to the precinct. The homicide detective told me I had to go to the coroner’s office to identify the body, but that office was already closed. I would have to wait till the next morning. I called a friend who worked homicide, and she told me that they did have a young man who fit the description of my Jay. At that point I decided to go to your grandfather’s house. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 15 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f16 shaka senghor The thought of confirming your death to him was crippling, almost too much to bear. When I arrived at his house, the street was packed with the cars of family members. I fumbled around in my pocket for the keys; just as I got to the door, your mother called me. “He’s here. Jay is alive,” she said. My body collapsed against the door. I breathed for what felt like the first time in hours. My vision cleared, the monsters stepped back, life came back into focus. It had all been a horrible misunderstanding; the missing young man was not you, Jay. You were alive. My son was alive. No longer did one of us have to go.

We held each other, two generations hoping we could build a better future for a third—­for you.

Already I knew that you would be an extraordinary addition to our beautiful, broken planet. I could sense your magic, your divinity, the great gift of your being growing each day and, as it grew, helping grow in me a new place, a place that you would fill to the brim. How did I know all that? To answer that, I would need to understand the secrets of the universe. (Spoiler alert: I do not understand the secrets of the Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 17 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f18 shaka senghor universe.) The love you feel for a child is elemental, the DNA of the planet. A lot of people believe in a divine power; others believe in the power of nature; but to me, the greatest power that drives our world is the love we have for our children. There is no love so selfless, so complete, so overwhelming. Sure, not all parents feel that way about their child, but for most of us, the love of a child is the deepest, most fulfilling love we’ll ever feel. It is different from love for a romantic partner, for a friend, or for a sister or brother or mother or father. It springs up unaided. It is chemical; we have no choice but to become as boring as hell as we talk N about how great our IO T kids are. I make no apologies for that. From the second you IBU R T S had a different hue.

Sekou, I love your musical laughter, your inherent intelligence, and your sense of humor. No matter where I am in the world, the simple thought of you causes my heart to grow. Son, love is the most powerful emotion we have, because it inspires us to give our all and sacrifice everything for those we care about. Love is sacred because it comes from the most authentic space inside of us. But love is not honored by ­everyone—​in fact, in some cultures, love is seen as weak, an emotion that proves weakness. For men especially, love can be seen as antithetical to our power, to our sense of masculinity, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 18 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 19 to the power we think we own. All this is bogus, garbage. It keeps men locked in a cold and lonely place. To my mind, loving someone is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes huge amounts of courage to love, because to love is to trust and believe in the greater good and to do so in a world in which trust is shattered. If you had told the boy I was, facing imprisonment for a terrible crime, that one day he would sit on a couch with his beautiful son by his side, listening to him read from a book, watching his perfect brown fingers curl around the edges of the pages, his sweet voice burbling along the words—­and that I would feel all the N love in the world—­ IO T well, I might have described such IBaUscene as either impossible R T S never allow. or a sign of a weaknessDI Icould R O is that this is strength; this is power; Fnow What I know OT N this is fulfillment—­sitting here, listening to you read.

T I But there is one S I DI’ve read: I need to give you key thing missing from the lists OR F T high-­level access to your NO emotions. Your power lies in your ability to grasp and unleash the power of being an emotionally evolved human being. The martial arts sage Bruce Lee instructed his students, “Be formless, be shapeless, like water.” Though he was talking about combat, I think this also applies to emotions. Water can take so many forms, from the deepest permafrost to the lightest mist of rain. When you are in tune with your emotions, you get to be anything you want to be—­lighter than air or as tough as the earth’s crust. Think about what water is—­a mixture of hydrogen, the lightest element in the periodic Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 19 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f20 shaka senghor table, and oxygen, which makes up almost half of the earth’s crust in the form of oxides. This is what you’re called to be—­ strong enough to sustain the weight of 7.5 billion people yet light enough to drift beyond the stratosphere; a mixture of solidity and fancy, a boy whose imagination will open his heart to all he meets. Son, the world doesn’t always look like a place filled with love, but trust me, love is present. Across the years I have met so many wonderful and caring people—­people who’ve helped me, challenged me, raised me up, loved N me, listened to me, IO T given me opportunities. SomeIBI U would even say saved me. R T Above them all is you.DIS R FOwhen The men ITmet I was incarcerated—­Gangster Al, O N Slim Hurney, Timothy Greer, and others—­those men saw something redeemable in me that I didn’t see in myself.

I in prison or is still in prison, some OR F T was one of the youngest NO in those maximum-­security facilities, yet they saw leadership in me, a man whom guys would rally around because I was able to express myself effectively. The books they gave me changed my life—­from Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill to Malcolm X’s autobiography, the novels of Donald Goines, and manifestos by Huey P. Newton. Because I read so fast, they tended to not believe me when I said I’d finished; they would challenge me on the details, just in case I hadn’t actually read it. That would lead to lengthy debates about so many things. What still moves me is the fact that those men had all come Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 20 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 21 in with life sentences, yet they still mentored the young. Even if the world felt they were on the scrap heap, they didn’t. They were determined to better both themselves and the younger men coming after. I am passing their love on to you. I understand that to you, this is just your life, these are just your days, this is just your natural way: to be kind and funny and interesting and goofy and thoughtful and loving and strong.

You leave trails of impressions on people, strong trails that affect their lives. Recently you explained the physics of one of your spinning toys to a friend of mine, startling him with your brain and your insight. You reminded him—­so he said later—­of both the beautiful innocence of childhood and the ability of a child’s mind to gobble up so much new information. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 21 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f22 shaka senghor I used to be terrible in the mornings—­don’t talk to me until one in the afternoon, that kind of thing. I had good reason: it’s hard to wake up in the morning when the first thing you hear is bars rattling open and desperate men rushing to the bathroom and fighting over toilets and showers. Each morning I would wake and think, “I’m here. The nightmare is still happening. It’s playing out in real life, not on a TV.” But you have your mother’s ability to get going first thing, and you’ve changed even that fundamental thing about me: I can deal with the a.m. now. When I was in prison, I dreaded mornings. Morning meant one more day in Hell. Sleep at least ION T gave me some peace, a few hours’ IBUworth of dreams, a break R T from the grind of incarceration—­ and I came to prefer it. But DIS R FOenergy fills me with hope not just for the now your morning OT N day at hand but for the years to come. It’s the opposite of that dread in my prison cell. Your connectivity and engagement N are impossible to resist. Our days are beautifulItogether, and TO U B the best part comes when each day reaches TRI its end. S I D Every night we do our affirmations. These words ensure OR F T that you know whoO N you are in the world before the world tries to tell you something different. We started when you were eighteen months old. You were just babbling at that point, but we couldn’t start early enough, and this was our house, and this was our new life, and there was never going to be enough time. Twenty years I’d lost; there was no time to waste. This is what you say (and what I say back): I’m great (Yes, you are). I’m awesome (Totally). I’m amazing (You amaze me every day). I’m thoughtful (I see that in Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 22 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 23 everything you do). I’m loving (I feel loved by you so much). I’m caring (It staggers me how much you care). I’m funny (Actually, you’re hilarious). I’m smart (Everyone says it). I’m a big boy (Getting bigger every day). I’m a soldier (In the war for love). I’m a warrior (You will change the world). I am Sekou. Sometimes if I have company over, and being the great spark you are, you naturally enough want to stay up with the adults.

We are onlyRever O F T way—­as trouble or danger NO or a problem to solve—­and that’s why these affirmations are so crucial. It’s as though we are, and always have been, America’s problem to solve. But we know that we are much more complex than that. We are not America’s problem. We’re not even each other’s problem. We’re just people, not three-­fifths but one; we’re humans, fumbling and stumbling along on this brief, accidental journey. I’m a father, a single father, and also a successful businessman, writer, activist, even if the culture doesn’t recognize me in those ways. It doesn’t see, or refuses to see, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 23 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f24 shaka senghor the love and caring and nurturing things we fathers do; we are just a problem, a symptom of decay or of danger, merely because of the color of our skin. It’s fine to fight against individual injustices, and we must do so—­but the wider issue is the instinctual cultural assumptions that so many hold. They will look at an innocent, beautiful boy—­you, Sekou—­and before they hear that you have empathy or wit or intelligence or gentleness or anything positive, they will assume that you are a problem to corral, a problem to solve, a problem to run from, a problem to lock up or even kill. This is our predicament, theNdisunion intrinsic TIO U to our union.

Though S I Dyou, Sekou, and against all there are forces ranged against OR F T young Black boys, you NO and those boys have a much stronger force within yourselves. The affirmations we share every night are a crucial antidote to those pressures. One thing I understood was that if your mother and I could prepare you to understand who you are very early on, we could begin to make you bulletproof; our love for you could not only be a salve but also a shield. Son, not only are you the future, you are the present, because your place on Earth right now—­right here this very moment—­is more important than anything else to me.

You are a latecomer in a tradition that has fought oppression, broken chains, marched and sung and written and taken the brickbats of a culture that sees us as only partly human and sometimes not even partly. But despite all this heavy history at your back, you are innocent. I will do everything to let that innocence continue for as long as I can. Thank you for bringing me so much laughter and light.

IThate O N you’ll know soon enough in any case. The word the world uses is racism—­or discrimN ination or injustice—­but I’d say it’s deeper TIO than U B the indignity of being measured TRIby the color of S I D to be at the root of one’s skin. Sure, racism R seems O F T this country’s engagement with the Black commuNO nity: the way opportunities are barred to us, the overpolicing, the violence we face, the casual way our culture expects us to be a problem. But there is something even more invasive and dangerous that we experience: the overwhelming feeling of dread. When we encounter racism on a near-­daily basis, it leaves us with a consistent, haunting feeling that we are about to be falsely accused, brutalized, or denied opportunities others see as their birthright. Are we going to be stereotyped just on the basis of Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 27 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f28 shaka senghor the color of our skin? That stereotyping stems from the dread of us in the racist culture in which we find ourselves. As we fight to change that racist culture—­a culture that enslaved, discriminated against, and lynched our ancestors—­we must also work on that feeling of dread; we need to corral it, tame it, not let it dominate our lives. This constant vigilance is what tires our souls, and it’s what I want to talk about. That we live in a racist society is a statement no less true for being obvious. We are aware of the criminalization of Black males as a matter of public policy; we can all see how the media depict Black men as a threat,Nas uncontrollable, TIOthings in society. We U as fundamentally opposed to the good B RI IST ungovernable cities, the threat hear the dog whistles D about R FOvitriol to the suburbs,Tthe about “making America great (i.e., O N white) again.” Black boys and men are a force to fear. There is no nuance to us. We’re fast or tall or strong or dangerous N or sexual or angry or all of the above. We are TIOnot subtle, U B that’s for sure. When one of us is shot TRIdead by the police, S I D some distant criminal every story makes sure to mention OR F T mugshot that has nothing to do charge—­what I callO“the N with the moment.” We are demonized. We don’t protest, we loot. Even the idiosyncrasies of our language work to depict Blackness as problematic: people are blacklisted, black cats are bad luck, there are black ice on roads and black sheep in families, reputations are blackened, and it’s all one big black mark upon our very name. Beneath all the reduction and slur is the sense that Black communities are monolithic—­that we are either rappers or sports stars or we’re dysfunctional, angry, violent, a threat. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 28 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 29 There’s even less nuance when you’re a felon. First up, housing: forget trying to rent (in most cases). Though there are laws against discriminating in the real estate market, there’s no rule against not renting to a person with a felony. Sekou, when I first got out, your mom and I were finally able to rent an apartment from a woman who looked the other way when she ran my record, but in that neighborhood, my Ford Taurus was stolen twice in two weeks. (It had nice rims, what can I say?) We couldn’t live in a place like that, not with a baby and your mom coming home late at night from work. But when we tried to move to somewhere safer, once again ION T the applications were denied. Eventually I found a way to get IBU R T IS mortgage route, but even then, a home outside of the D usual R FOhouse insurance—­and when we moved to I could barelyTget O N this new house in Los Angeles, even though I applied through USAA via my dad’s military service, still I was turned down.

Getting a job wasn’t easy, either.RAfter T I one interview, I S I D of my felony, the company was told straight out that because OR F T didn’t feel comfortable NO hiring me. I was exhausted from running from the reality of my past. These are the macroproblems, but the microtraumas are what really drive the exhaustion. When we got Indyego, Sekou, you were so excited. I hope you always remember how much it meant to set eyes on that puppy that first day. I wasn’t sure about getting a dog, but he’s pretty cute with those light inverted commas framing his marblelike gray eyes. He’s added so much love and light to Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 29 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f30 shaka senghor our lives already. There’s a purity to an animal that we human animals have lost. A dog can remind you of the instinctual element of love that too often gets harassed into pain. But even having a dog isn’t unalloyed joy; not when we’re forever having to prove something about ourselves as a race. Let me explain what I mean. Recently when you were staying with your mom, Indy got sick and shit all over his cage in the middle of the night. Usual puppy stuff.

I’m not the biggest fan of cleaning dog shit out of a cage at ION T 3:00 a.m., but it had to be done. IBU R T After rinsing the thing DIS out, I realized that I was making R FOwith the cage and the water hose and me a lot of noise,Twhat O N cursing my luck.

I’d be told to keep my hands where they could be seen, and I’d be asked for my ID. “Well, Officer, I don’t tend to carry ID when I’m cleaning shit out of a dog crate at three in the morning. . . . And can I prove I live here? Well, I can, but only if you let me into my house to show you my ID.” And round and round it goes, unless the officer gets jumpy, and then all bets are off. This is what we live with all the time: something simple and already fairly degrading—­cleaning up puppy shit—­turns into something potentially dangerous. Or we’re sitting in our car somewhere, taking in the sunrise or the sunset, and Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 30 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 31 suddenly we don’t have enough air in our tires or our blinker is out, and they can check your car, check your person, and run your life through that little computer that holds the keys to prisons all over America. But despite all of this, despite the fear that sets in when I’m simply trying to exist, I want to believe in the best of what it means to be human. And I truly do believe we have the skill set to fix a lot of this; it doesn’t have to be like this forever.

Or how about in a high-­end store? Being followed all the way around the place until finally the clerk asks, “Can I help you?” These are the exhausting things. One morning after the Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd murders, I stepped outside our home to get the mail, and I froze. I had a hoodie on. What if one of my neighbors called the police? All this from a hoodie. What is my story if the police show up? Will I be approached as a homeowner or a suspect? The only way I’ve found to combat this is to remain Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 31 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f32 shaka senghor mindful, to tell myself, “This isn’t happening, this isn’t your reality. Not all people are racist; not all cops are assholes.” I learned that a couple of years ago in Cincinnati. It was a Friday night. I was standing outside a barbershop with a small group of mostly Black men. That year, the Smithsonian had organized a traveling exhibit called Men of Change, which I had been lucky enough to be featured in. Wherever the exhibit went, barbershops in the community could enter a contest to win $10,000 to rehab the place.

O N From what I could make out, he was saying “What the fuck? Nobody is fucking impeding traffic here.” He had a look of total disgust on his face, as though he couldn’t believe he’d had to follow up some bullshit call. Apparently some car had passed us, and the driver had seen three Black men standing on the corner in front of the barbershop and called the police, saying we were blocking traffic with a car. (There was no car.) As the officer reached us, I just said, “Hey, how’s it going today?” At that, he stopped and looked me in the face. “Man, it’s Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 32 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 33 just this dumbass call, and I have to follow up,” he explained. I could tell from the start that he was as annoyed as we were. I nodded. “Man, I get it. But nobody’s impeding traffic here. I was just out here smoking a cigar and celebrating this barbershop thing. In fact, you should come inside.” He seemed tempted—­amazed, even—­but he said he didn’t want to ruin the fun by stepping in. “If I walk in, your party goes flat,” he said. We both nodded in acknowledgment of the reality of the distrust between the community and police officers. I liked the man. He had a soul, and he N was sensitive to the IO T bullshit he’d been fed by the caller. IBU When I asked him how R T long he’d been on the force, DIS he said ten months. “You should R FO I told him. “If you’re going to be patrolreally come in,Tthen,” O N ling around here, barbershops are a staple in the community.” When he still demurred, I mentioned to him that Jerome N Bettis and Roland Martin were inside, and at that TIO he pretty U B much lost his mind. “You gotta be shitting TRI me! The Bus is S I D in there?” OR F T At that, I sent someone NO in to get Jerome and explained to him when he came out that this officer had looked past the bullshit to see the human beings in front of him. Jerome shook his hand, and the cop said, “Man, if my dad was still alive, he would be so excited. You were his favorite player.” It was a wonderful moment of hero worship, of fathers and sons and humanity, and I sensed then a kind of breaking, a fissure in the pain we all carried around with us. Unbeknown to me, a friend, Ernest Sisson, took a picture of the moment. In it, you can see the wide-­eyed innocence of a young white cop realizing, I think, that life was going to be Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 33 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f34 shaka senghor more complex, interesting, and beautiful than he could ever have imagined. (Oh, and by the way, he’s no longer a cop.) When I wrote about that incident a few months later, it instantly went viral—­and that’s because, I think, it was one of those moments that reminded all of us of our humanity, our frailties, and our similarities. In that moment we were all just men navigating the world without the mask we’d been trained to wear. I could have taken offense, called out the officer, and accused him of being a racist cop; he could have believed the caller and acted based on stereotypes about Black men in groups. Instead, somehow, we chose to just see each ION T U other and talk like humans. It’sIB ultimately a decision we can R T S a kid at seeing his dad’s sports all make.

TRI S I D We chose to see beyond theRuniforms we were wearing. We O F can always choose this. OT N Not everyone is out to get you, but the reality remains: you are Black men. You fit the description. I can’t tell you how many times I get into a limo and the driver asks if I’m a rapper or do I play football? Hotel check-­ins? Same. (Sometimes it’s easier to get my white colleagues to check if my room is ready.) Because of the nature of my work, I’m often the only Black man in a lot of white spaces. At hotels and resorts and conferences, oftentimes the only other Blacks I see are in the Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 34 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 35 service industry. My white peers’ experience of these settings is very different from mine. It’s not just that I’m ignored; I’m actually made to feel invisible. As I’m waiting for a table in a restaurant, a group of white people will come in after me and the maître d’ will walk right past me to tend to them first. When I first moved into an apartment building in Hollywood, my midwestern soul found it natural to say hello to folks in the elevator, but it was a rare thing to be acknowledged, let alone get a hello back. When I got a puppy, things changed a bit—­people were quite happy to say hello (to the puppy). Compare that to ION T when a Black person does something IBU notable; then he can’t R T help but be seen. DIS R FOmiss the mark. Sometimes I’ll get calls Even alliesTcan O N after one of those awful high-­profile assaults or murders—­“If only he hadn’t resisted” or “But his record suggests he was N violent.” Do I assume that these people are racist? TIO If so, what U B good will it do me? TRI S I D space for a legitimate Even when you’re in a legitimate OR F T reason, the white culture NO can still swoop in and question you. I was out back at the Grammys when a white woman came up to me and asked, “Hey, which group are you? Are you a solo artist?” When I said no, she asked, “So do you work for an artist?” “Nope. Just here with friends,” I said. “Did you sneak in?” she asked with a side-­eye. She was fixated on how I had gotten into the Grammys. There had to be a reason, given that I’m Black—­it couldn’t just be that, like her, I was just there. A writer? Sorry, don’t Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 35 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f36 shaka senghor get it. I can’t be a writer, a consultant, a thinker, a teacher, a professor. In that moment, I could have called her out as racist or I could have called out the entire culture that gives her the right to question me—­and what’s the betting she’s got “tons of Black friends”? The bottom line is, what you realize in such moments is that we’re constantly being delegitimized. Then there was the time I was flying back from Boston to Los Angeles. Right off the plane, two white guys—­so obviously plainclothes cops that it was almost comical—­were watching everyone walk along the concourse. One of them ION T U Terry?” What the fuck? approached me and asked, “AreIByou R T IS at which point he asked to see “No, I’m not Terry,” IDsaid, R FO my ID. OT N I just kept on walking.

The encounter didn’t escalate, fortunately (because I would have been in the wrong, no question—­that’s how it is), but to anyone watching from a distance—­the people I’d just flown with for five hours, all now passing me on their way home, casting glances at me—­I Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 36 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 37 was clearly the bad guy, when in reality the idiot simply didn’t know how to do his job. The dread is constant. Even though I knew I was in the right, still I found myself thinking, “Is everything straight? Did I do something in Boston? Do I have weed?” The continuous pricks at our identity are agonizing. How am I to navigate them? How are you to do so? If you don’t have the mechanism to self-­affirm or reimagine who such people are—­for example, that they are victims of cultural ignorance inside a racist system rather than merely racist—­you will find life unbearable, and we must avoid the ledge.

We have NO to learn to process the pain, because if all you do is internalize it, you’ll never have happiness and fulfillment because you’ll never feel safe. People are yearning for the good. Most people want to see racial reconciliation. How can we get there? For me, the journey began with one step: resolving the puzzle in my head. Thinking back to that night in Cincinnati, my typical response to a cop might well have been “Well, what the fuck you want from us now?” On the cop’s side, he was probably thinking “Fuck, now I’m already here, and my presence is Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 37 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f38 shaka senghor a threat to them.” But as each of us worked out the other’s humanity, I remember seeing the wave of relief cross his face; we were present to each other as two human beings. I didn’t escalate the incident, but that wasn’t even my job. It had already been escalated. We had been called in as a threat, and then the cop had had to come by, escalating further. There had already been three distinct escalations in that situation, none of them due to me. The culture escalates without effort. What matters is not escalation or de-­escalation—­it’s mindfulness, which I see as the gateway to reconciliation. MindfulION T ness is a practice in which youIbring BU yourself completely to R T S the narrative that’s constantly the present moment; you DIcheck R O and recognize what’s happening right Fhead running in your OT N in front of you as well as inside of you. Instead of telling the woman at the Grammys to go fuck herself, I brought myself N to the realization that it was my first time at the TIO Grammys, U B and on that particular night they would TRI be paying homage S I D same morning. That was to Kobe Bryant, who’d diedRthat O F T what mattered, not some NO random person questioning how I had gotten in. In moments like this, mindfulness—­not the woo-­woo, softy-­softy kind but a real and intense effort to play witness to actions and feelings with clarity and calmness—­is the first step not only to solving the painful event but to gaining an internal peace. It’s crucial to realize that what happens inside us is more important than what’s happening in the material world around us. Reconciliation begins with fixing what’s inside. It creates space for an authentic beauty in which we can be honest with friends—­and random cops—­about the Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 38 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 39 nuance of our existence. When we talk about such incidents, you’ll find that real friends can hold a space for the facts. They will love you for you, not for your ability to fight against this or that or the other. I can see you rolling your eyes. At what point are we allowed to be human and it doesn’t cost our fucking life? Well, here we are, the children of four hundred years of agony. We can only allow ourselves to be human and care for our own internal narratives while hoping that others will eventually follow. Be mindful for the sake of your sanity so that you can be fully present in the world, even when itNfeels as though the TIO U world doesn’t welcome your presence.

Oh, and don’t forget—­in moments that could go either way, it helps to have Jerome Bettis behind you in a barbershop.

The driveway at the side of our house is separated from the garage by a huge wooden gate. From the other side, I heard your trilling voice shouting, “Daddy!” As I ran toward you, I called you “Poopy-­ Doopy,” because that’s what dads do. I hit the latch, the gate swung open, and there you were with your backpack and your cool sneakers and the smile that lights up half of Los Angeles. Your mother and I chatted about things parents chat about: her not Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 41 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f42 shaka senghor having had time to wash your hair, my needing to remind you to submit your homework. A lovely excitement charged the air among the three of us, as in just one week we would be celebrating your ninth birthday. You kissed your mother goodbye and bounced into the yard, already looking forward, I think, to being back in our house. You love your time with your mom, of course, but I like to think you’re happy to come back here, too, to your couch and your bed and your big-­ass TV and your chess set and your everything.

So I wait and listen and let you have your thirty minutes.

Being a father means building a scaffold of love upon which your child can climb; in the days you’ve been away, I have dismantled some of that scaffold so that I don’t go crazy from missing you. There is a trope in our culture of the absent father and the sainted single mother, but the reality for so many of us is actually agony. Do you really think we want to be away from our children? Who would choose such a thing? Relationships end, and the culture is adamant that the mother shall take the lead in parenting and spending time with and nurturing.

ButO N such thoughts are dispelled as you come running out of the house, leap across my chest into my arms, and say, “Daddy, we need to make a list!” Such enthusiasms—­ instant, passionate, real—­are what children bring to our dark world. There are groceries to get, and when you ask me if it’s okay if you make the list, though I fear what it will contain—­pizza, probably, and what else?—­of course you can make it. This is your effort to regain your home, to fill it with nourishment, and because you are a darling boy, you make sure to remember the things I want to eat and drink. I tell you about a ginger ale from Detroit called Vernors, and Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 43 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f44 shaka senghor how sometimes Ralph’s has it. (In Detroit, Vernors isn’t just a soda; it is believed to fix all and any ailments. Got a headache? Drink Vernors. Upset stomach? Drink Vernors. Hell, it might even kill Covid.) The fact that Ralph’s may have a bottle of this drink/potion is enough to excite you beyond all reason, because what if Ralph’s does have Vernors and you can try it, and also can we get pizza? Of course we can, because pizza is the shortest way I know to making it clear that I love you. But before we shop, we decide to head out to shoot some hoops. I got pretty good in prison until I tore my ACL. (In prison, there’s no way you’re getting surgery for a torn ACL; ION T the best you can hope for is some IBU Motrin.) In the yard, I R T IS drain without really trying, but would drain and drainDand R O showing signs of talent, too. You bring Fare you at just eight OT N your right hand up high, and, whoosh, you hurl that ball, and it clangs off the backboard and in.

Here we are, enjoying a simple game of basketball in a yard in our house in Los Angeles, but quickly I find myself thinking about love and how the boys and men with whom I lived in prison displayed such little of it toward themselves. How could they, given the degradation of their pasts, the degradation of their daily lives inside? As I learned their stories, I came to appreciate how a lack Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 44 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 45 of self-­love had often led to the bad decisions and pain that brought them to this place. I think about those guys every time we play. For you, it’s just a fun activity with your dad, but for me, and for many of those men, it’s a crucial salve against the brutality of our lives. I’ve always been a huge basketball fan. I grew up a Pistons nut, from the bad-­boy era. I especially loved Isiah Thomas—­ not the biggest but the boldest. As he once said, he was never chasing Michael Jordan, it was the other way round. (Thomas already had two championships before Jordan got ION T U sport and was good at it his first.)

S I D about basketball beyond So far, you don’t really give aRshit O F T this driveway, and that’s NO fine by me. It’s the time together that matters. So on we go, shooting hoops, here in this LA yard, just a couple of miles from the home of the Lakers, who had just won the championship; LeBron’s fourth, three with different teams. He, too, had succeeded against the odds. He was from Akron, less than 200 miles from Detroit, born to Gloria, his mother, when she was sixteen. His father was absent, the family struggled to make ends meet, and Gloria knew it would be better for LeBron to live with a local youth football coach than Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 45 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f46 shaka senghor with her. Imagine her having to make that decision; giving up her son to secure him a future. Now there he is just a few miles from us, winning it all for the fourth time. These are the things I think about as you throw the ball up into the air toward the hoop in this game by which men have made something out of nothing. Toward the end of my sentence, my friend Calvin and I created a class based on the ideas in the book Houses of Healing: A Prisoner’s Guide to Inner Power and Freedom by Robin Casarjian. Initially we invited just six guys to meet N and talk about their IO T feelings, and it was incredibleIto BUwitness their outpouring R T IS about parental abuse,D violence, neglect, and PTSD.

T I S I D someone care as much Back then, I dreamed of Rhaving O F T about me as I care about NO you now and as much as you care about me. There’s a song by Nas called “One Love,” in which he talks about caring for his friend who is on lockdown. I remember lying on my bunk listening to that song and bolting straight up with a shock of recognition, realizing that that was the kind of love I was missing: someone to leave fifty bucks in the commissary for me, or just someone to tell me to “rise up above.” I wanted someone to write me a letter, to tell me the news from home and say that they were thinking about me. I wanted someone to come visit me. I wanted someone to believe in me even though I had hit the rockiest of bottoms. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 46 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 47 The truth back then was that most of my friends had abandoned me. There were no letters, no visits, nothing to remind me that I had been a full human before incarceration. And that hurt so much; it took me years to realize that the truth was that they didn’t really love themselves. The reality is that they had suffered the same kind of childhood trauma, abuse, and gun violence that I had. That made it nearly impossible for them to be there for me because they still hadn’t worked out how to be there for themselves. Not their bad; not mine.

These rules createRan O F T hearing the story of Bakithi memory. I remember NO Kumalo, the South African bass player. When Paul Simon brought him over to New York from apartheid South Africa to play on the Graceland album, Kumalo asked where the nearest police station was so he could register. That was what Blacks had to do in his homeland, and it’s what I have to do in mine. We’re horrified when we hear about the degradations of apartheid, but there are other, less obvious blocks to freedom: the inner terrors, the everyday Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 49 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f50 shaka senghor experience of being denied basic rights, things that take a lifetime to seep away—­if they ever do. But those first months . . . ​even though I had to go to the parole office before I did anything, when I talked to Ebony the night before and she told me you were going to be joining her to pick me up, I got so excited. In my mind, it was working out to be the perfect homecoming. Do you remember that day? It is a blur to me, just as some of the first few days kind of merge together like cars on the freeway during rush-hour traffic. So much had changed since I’d been incarcerated in 1991. The Internet had become a thing only N after I had gone to IO T prison. Amazon.com had launched IBU in 1995, and DVDs had R T shown up around the same DIS time. The iPod, now pretty much R O shown up until 2001. Any portable Fhadn’t obsolete itself, OT N phones I’d known had been cinder blocks; now everyone carried a pocket-­sized computer that could facilitate talking to N anyone on the planet at any time. Imagine, then, TIO the shock U IB finally released. I of adjusting to life in June 2010, when R T I was S I D Fred Flintstone stepping once described myself as being like OR F T into an episode of The NOJetsons. I went into prison as a kid, and I came out with the naiveté of a kid. Being away for so long creates a kind of arrested development; it’s seen regularly in women and men who go away when they are young and come back decades later. It wasn’t as if I hadn’t been through trauma and harsh realities of my own, realities that had matured me in my own way. I had taken care of myself while in prison, but there were still some experiences I just hadn’t had, couldn’t have had given that I’d been incarcerated. I’d never had a bank account; never Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 50 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 51 had a legitimate job; never had a driver’s license; never had a car in my own name. Most of what I thought I knew about life was based on ideas I had formulated from reading books and magazines. There were none of the trials and errors that come with living life. Things like ordering in a fancy restaurant; knowing the dress code for an interview (I hadn’t worn a suit since being sentenced in 1991); navigating a Word document (I thought Microsoft Word was the Internet); or going on a date (a date that required flowers and planning). I could only imagine how I would respond, react, and act in this lifeN on the outside. And IO T though I knew the facts of your life outside, I hadn’t lived IBU R T through those things with DISyou. Your life was a tale told to me R O Fsomething secondhand, not we’d shared. OT N When I first stepped out of the parole office into the parking lot, I remember feeling as though we—­you, me, Ebony, N all of us—­were about to conquer the world. IIO T also rememU B ber wanting to set the tone for what R T I Iimagined our future S I D you to know that I was together would look like. I wanted OR F T truly a man of my word. NO So many of the men who had gotten out before me had talked about what they were going to do when they got home—­some wanted to be real estate investors, some musicians, some business owners, everything you could imagine. But year after year, I had watched many of those men with hopes come back into prison, their plans and dreams and hopes crushed like old cars in a junkyard. Being jailed is antithetical to the human spirit; it works to kill the spirit. I think we can all stop lying that prison is about rehabilitation—­for centuries, and especially in this one, its Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 51 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f52 shaka senghor chief function has been to punish and mar the human spirit in an act of monstrous revenge. It was disheartening. What did it mean for those of us still in prison who harbored our own hopes and dreams? Would we face the junkyard, too? It was terrifying to consider. “Outside” held such an allure for us, but we saw that “outside” was harsh and unwelcoming and could crush a man. Brilliant, talented men were regularly coming back to a life of hell. What were we to do with that information? Should we bury it as we did so much of the trauma we faced? Should we reassess our dreams? Should we stop dreaming altogether? ION T U Should we just assume that theIBoutside world would render R T us useless, broken, crushed DIS into boxes of metal? In the face of R FOtheir eyes a little more dead than before, the men returning, OT N I remember telling myself that their fate wasn’t going to be my fate. But inside me, deep deep inside me, there was a voice N telling me that I wasn’t any different from them. TIO “Who are U B you,” the voice asked, “to think that you TRI can escape the fate S I D is it about you, Shaka, of these great men returning? What OR F T that will make you strong NO enough to not return? Do you have that soul? Have you created that soul in your writings, in your dreams, in your hopes for the future? Are you that man, Shaka?” That voice didn’t ruin me, though. In fact, I worked even harder to make sure I proved it wrong. I wanted you to see that the things I’d said to you in letters and visits and calls were real. I would live by them and enact them with you and for you. I hated that voice inside me, but I knew, too, that it would save me. It would keep my eyes alive. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 52 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 53 * * * Now I was outside, and though the voice could sometimes chill me, I also knew that I would have to get past the parties and celebrations and set the tone for what I wanted the future to look like. I had dreamed of running my own business for years and couldn’t wait to get started. I will never forget my first book sale with you there in the parking lot at the parole office. Do you remember? I had met the brother I sold the book to during the last sixty days inside prison, in the dayroom at Mound Correctional Facility. We had talked about the countdown toN freedom as though IO T we were old friends, just two men IBUfacing down the dead eyes R T of the men who had returned. DIS I remember telling that man I R FO when I got out, and he said he wanted wanted to be an author OT N to support me and would push my books for me. In my mind, I imagined that we would connect after we were home for a N day we while, but he said he wanted to buy a book theIOvery T U B were released. TRI S I D like, what that did to my Can you imagine what that felt OR F T soul? I’m filled with O N pride when I think about that first sale out of the trunk of a car. I had shown that I wasn’t going to be crushed like a useless vehicle, I was going to sell a book and sell it to a brother who had come home like me. Beyond how important that was to my soul, there was also the symbolism of the sale as a sign to you of what I was going to be, what I was going to represent. I wanted to impress upon you that I was serious about building a life of accomplishment and that I was coming home to put in real work. Did you see that? Did that prove to you that I was going to make it outside and not be crushed like so much old metal? Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 53 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f54 shaka senghor * * * From that moment to this day, I haven’t stopped pushing for my dream. But I have grown into a deeper realization of what I needed to be for you. You didn’t need to see me stick to a plan for myself, didn’t need me to set an example of work ethic or be an entrepreneur or writer or a man outlasting his prison to be something notable and someone to look up to. The truth is, I was so caught up in my own shit that I hadn’t considered that maybe all you really needed was for me to just be present. Jay, this is the complexity of being a parent. Sometimes we can be seduced into thinking that ourNdreams of making IO UT it, whatever that means—­ourIsuccesses, our accolades and B R T S we can give our children. The triumphs—­are the best DIgifts R FOwhat my friend Dr. Shefali calls “parenting truth is, that’sTjust O N with our ego attached.” Our entire culture tells us that that’s what parents are for—­to be heroes, running into fires, making N money, getting the corner office or the record Ideal, T O winning U B at life. But the truth is, parents just need TRI to be there for their S I D they’re doing when their children. They need to stop R what O F T child talks, and they need NO to listen. Looking back, there are so many things that I wish I could have done differently as your father. I wish I had spent more time explaining to you why I was going so hard to make my dreams happen—­I was running, yes, running from my past, but I was also running from the fear of returning to the streets and going back to prison. I was running from the image of those men I’d seen return, their dead eyes, their dreams of “outside” crushed. And it wasn’t just that I was running from reincarceration. No, I was running because I was afraid of what a return would do to me, knowing that the system had won. It had been ahead of me for Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 54 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 55 so long; it had run up the score; there were just a few minutes left and the buzzer was approaching, and could I really force a comeback? Could I really run the ball up the court and make the shot that said I was a man, free, unbeaten, and unbeatable? I knew I had to keep moving, pushing, forging ahead. In prison there was only one thing I was afraid of, and that was losing my mind. That fear remained even after I was on the outside. I thought back to so many moments when I realized I’d been incarcerated to be broken. One day I was talking to an officer who had come to my cell to do a routine shakedown. He discovered that I had more books and toiletries than ION T allowed and demanded that I send IBUthem home. He wouldn’t R T IS books to others on the block or even allow me to passDthe R FOIt was such a dumb policy, barring us from share the toiletries. OT N helping our fellow prisoners with things they couldn’t afford. I was incensed—­how could this person be in control of me, N of all of us? I was smarter, more inquisitive, more TIO analytical U B than this guy would ever be, but somehow TRI he was able to lock S I D eat, when I would go to me into a cage, dictate what IRwould O F T bed—­in fact, he hadOcomplete control over my life and my N fate. If he wanted to be violent toward me, the system would let him. He could come in and shake down the cell whenever he wanted to, throw my belongings on the floor, put things I’d legitimately bought into the trash, deny me food in solitary, and put sworn enemies into the same cell. He could throw away my mail or deny visits for no reason. If he wanted to dehumanize me with a word, he could do so with no sanction. In that moment, I promised myself that I would never again put myself into a situation where my life would be controlled by someone who was barely intelligent enough to tie Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 55 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f56 shaka senghor his own shoes. The thought of going back to a space where that was the daily reality was frightening as hell. So this was what I did: once I was outside, I hit every park, every barbershop, and every strip club I could think of and tried to sell books to anyone and everyone I encountered—­ including the Jehovah’s Witnesses who came to my door (true story). I was taking all of the shit I had learned in the streets and on prison yards and adding it to what I knew people might call “legitimate.” I had studied marketing and read books like Think and Grow Rich. On the back of whatN I’d learned, I set up IO T U fifteen to twenty books readings and book signings andIBsold R T IS sometimes less. I offered people, each time—­sometimesD more, R FOopportunity to hustle and make five dolincluding you,Tthe O N lars per book sold. Some were unwilling to hustle, so I got out there myself. I tried everything from multilevel marketing N to selling T-­shirts. My new friend Clement “Fame” TIO Brown U B and I opened a had a boutique on the west side, on JoyRRoad, T I S I D next to the clothes Fame bookstore in the front of the R store, O F T had designed. NO But the truth was this: I needed merely to be present for you. Yes, I wanted you to see me making my way in the world after two decades inside, but I should also have just sat with you, let you talk, let you be, let our lives just mesh quietly, away from commerce and books and dreams of success. Remember the time I took you with me to my old neighborhood in Brightmo’? I was selling books at Motor City Java House; I was so happy to have you with me, this tall and beautiful boy. I was excited to see the Jay that I’d heard so much about—­the jokester, the charming hustler, the artist Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 56 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 57 and hard worker. I thought it was the beginning of our touring the world, and I couldn’t have been happier. But there I was, wanting more than anything for you to be a part of the dream I was building while ignoring what you really wanted. I didn’t know what that was, because I didn’t ask. That was the most important thing I should have done; I didn’t do it. I tell you this with humility and sorrow. It has taken me many years to unravel this. I will keep picking at it until I know I have revealed—­to myself as much as to you—­the depths of the trauma I have faced. I cannot be afraid of that ION T yard where the great magnet picks IBU up lives and drops them R T into some kind of crushing DIS machine.

You’re going to have a big effect upon the world, but to do so, you have to gain control of who you are and what you offer. When I was released from prison in 2010, a year and a half before you were born, a lot of people urged me to remain silent about my past. I was told to simply get a job at a gas station or a fast-­food joint and go about my life, keeping my head down Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 59 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f60 shaka senghor and hiding from the things I’d done. In telling me to hide, they were in essence telling me to wait for someone else to tell me when it was okay to be me. I could have followed their advice, for sure; working in a gas station or slinging burgers for a living might have been the easier route, given everything I’d been through. But I chose differently, for a few reasons. First, I knew that I could never be fully present to myself without addressing my past. Second, I couldn’t have avoided that past even if I’d tried. On every job or housing application I filled out, I was asked if I had been convicted of a crime. To so many people, I was not someone who had committed ION T U a murderer and always murder twenty years before; IIBwas R T would be. I was physically DISand emotionally a completely difR O I no longer even had the same cells as that ferent person—­ hFell, OT N nineteen-­year-­old boy—­but that mark would remain on me forever, it seemed. N a tech Today, I’m fortysomething years old. I’m aIfather, TO U B executive in a C-­suite. I collect sneakers. TRII mentor kids across S I D wanting to shout to the the country. Yet I still find myself OR F T world, “This is who O N I am today!” I am not that boy with the gun in his hand. Back then, a lot of my friends were still in prison, and I knew that no matter what I did in my own life, I would never be truly free if I forgot about the men I’d left behind. We’d grown up together, shared our lives for two decades, been through so many of the same things in prison. Sometimes we didn’t even need to communicate; we just knew what it felt like to be treated as less than human. Those men had become my friends, and friends don’t leave friends behind. It’s the same attachment military veterans feel toward their units. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 60 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 61 On the day I left prison, a guard told me he expected to see me back in six months; he said it casually, as though nothing I could possibly do would change the course of my postincarceration life. That was a decade ago. But even though I took a risk and decided to speak publicly about my story, I still find myself fighting a daily battle to write a true and real narrative that honors all of who I am. There is the public me, and then there is the private me, with all his secret moments of struggle. It’s not easy to translate such a life onto the page, to speak honestly and fully about ION T it. You must affirm yourself daily; IBUotherwise you’ll be pushed R T and pulled as though you’re DIS in constant bad weather. You need R FO to find the peace inside yourself that comes from knowing OT N who you are and what you stand for and what you want to show to the world. N TIO U B I was lucky that I didn’t have to fight those TRI fights alone. In the S I Dcommunity among countless years since my release, I’ve found OR F T people who are also O N fighting to change the criminal justice system. By 2015, five years after I’d been released, the conversation around criminal justice was heating up. In her book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, the brilliant Michelle Alexander had put the world on notice that the criminal justice system was reintroducing racist laws and a new version of slavery to Black and Brown communities. I was being called on more and more to speak out about the inhumanity of the system. Through my work with BMe, a network of leaders that Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 61 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f62 shaka senghor invests in Black men throughout the United States, men who usually struggle to get enough funding to do the work to enhance the quality of life in their communities, I met MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito. He and I had become close friends, to the point where I often stayed at his home when I was in Boston. We spent many late evenings discussing the injustices taking place in our judicial system, including the death of Aaron Swartz. Aaron was a young tech prodigy who had committed suicide after being indicted for downloading academic journal articles illegally and other crimes, which carried a sentence of up to thirty-­five years in prison and $1 million in ION T fines. I recall sitting up late at Inight BU with Joi discussing how R T IS to steal a young life like Aaron’s messed up the systemD was R FOdo about it. We didn’t know quite what to and what we could OT N do, but we knew that together we could find the right people to help us figure it out. N During a conversation with Joi, I decidedIO T to write my U B memoir, Writing My Wrongs: Life, Death, TRI and Redemption in an S I D conversation had become American Prison, because I feltR the O F T so academic that theO N human element had all but been erased. There were facts and figures, but what of the daily lived experience across two decades—­what was each moment like, what were the feelings like? How much, in short, did it cost? I self-­ published my memoir and began hustling copies out of the trunk of my car. Slowly, requests for me to speak about my prison experience began to pick up. Within months of publishing my memoir I had become a public figure, speaking to crowds, telling my story over and over. By the end of the year, I had been extended an invitation to teach at the University of Michigan by Professor Ashley Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 62 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 63 Lucas. We had met in prison during a Prison Creative Arts Project theater workshop. Students who enrolled in the class got to make theater, do creative writing, and attend visual arts workshops. There was also a yearly art exhibit featuring work by incarcerated men and women. Those workshops were an incredible lifeline; they offered us a creative outlet and an opportunity to connect with artists in the free world. When I met Ashley in prison, I just knew that we would find a way to collaborate when I was released. Several years later, it happened. Professor Lucas and I co-­founded and taught a course called “The AtonementNProject,” based on TIO U an arts-­and tech-­based project I had started as part of my B I R T fellowship at MIT Media DISLab. We were later nominated for R FO dollar award (which I clearly didn’t a TED Prize, T a million-­ O N win). But the nomination reflected the reality that people were ready to have meaningful conversations about criminal N justice reform, and we ended up becoming one TIO of twenty U B global finalists—­all after being told that TRI I would be back in S I D prison in six months. OR F T That all came about NO because I was determined to write my own story, create my own narrative, and not wait for the world outside prison to accept me or open doors for me. I already knew that the world didn’t work that way. We were on a trash heap; nothing was expected of us. I wanted so passionately to change the story, to show that I was alive, fully human, and ready to take my place. Soon, Joi had brought a new person into my orbit, but I couldn’t imagine why at first. When Joi first introduced me to the CNN host and Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 63 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f64 shaka senghor contributor Van Jones, I thought Joi was crazy to think we’d be friends and collaborators. Van and I couldn’t have been more different. On the surface, Van seemed like a straitlaced, if eloquent, nerd. He wore tailored suits and wire-­rimmed glasses and had a clean-­shaven head and a neatly trimmed mustache. I wore loose street apparel and fashionable sneakers, with a ubiquitous Detroit Tigers hat covering a head full of locks. Van’s interviews were polished, professional, and eloquent, while mine were straightforward, raw, and jagged around the edges. But as soon as we connected, all those differences disappeared; I realized immediately that Van was ION T genuine, thoughtful, and razorIsharp. BU His passion for justice R T and equality leapt through DIS the phone as we talked in depth R FofOBlack people and where we were headed about the state OT N as a country. We talked for nearly two hours, and by the end of our N call I felt as though we had known each otherIfor T O years. We U B discussed fatherhood, the experience of TRIbeing a Black man in S I D we could do together to America, police brutality, andRwhat O F T change the systems that NO were threatening to rip the country apart. I was impressed by Van’s intelligence and deep spiritual values. He was impressed, I like to think, by my resilience and my refusal to let my past cloud my hopeful vision for the future. When our call ended, I felt as though something divine had happened. Several months later, I ran into Van at a conference in Dallas. I was having dinner in the lobby with a group of my fellows whom I had met through a fellowship with the Kellogg Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 64 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 65 Foundation. (They were an amazing group of women turned friends whom I later dubbed “The Queens.”) We were three drinks in, talking about our work in Michigan and how it connected to larger issues, when Van walked in. I went and greeted him and asked if he had a moment to join us. He kindly accepted, but I didn’t know back then that Van didn’t drink, and I am sure we were probably a bit obnoxious, considering that we had been engrossed in what we called our “drunken wisdom circle.” Van was gracious with his time, though, and eventually he and I were able to talk privately about our work. ON TIcalled U Van told me about an organization #cut50, a biparIB R T tisan group brought together DIS to work out how to reduce both R FO crime and incarceration across all fifty states. At the time, OT N he was just getting it off the ground. His co-­founder and the executive director of #cut50 was an amazing woman named N Jessica Jackson whom Van described as one of the TIO most kick-­ U B ass humans he had ever met. Once I met TRIJessica, I understood S I D her that way. Southern immediately why he had characterized OR F T born and molded in the NO fires of the injustice system, she had gone back to college to become a lawyer after her husband had received an excessive prison sentence. She was ready to change the world, even if she had to do it alone. Unbeknown to me, she had already seen a talk I’d given, and she wanted to collaborate. It was easy for me to join their efforts, but even so, Van leapt out of his seat and let out a yelp when I agreed to be part of his and Jessica’s work. (That yelp is something we joke about to this day.) All these years and many battles later, we are still at war against a justice system that seeks to destroy communities Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 65 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f66 shaka senghor rather than build them. Jessica, Matt Haney (another co-­ founder), and Van were all way smarter than I will ever be politically. They understood how to work with politicians from across the aisle, and their legal training helped them navigate how to create workable policies. Yet I felt that I had something to add to the team. That proved to be true about a year later, when we hosted the largest bipartisan summit on criminal justice in the country’s history. We initially thought we would start with twenty or so people from both parties. We ended up with close to eight hundred. N TIO U The entire team worked around the clock connecting with IB R T S governors, senators, and who were advocating DIstakeholders R O even secured an exclusive interview Fteam for justice.

R D O T Fwe had gone from talking about In a matter of weeks, O N changing the system to actually starting to do it, there at the highest levels of power. Later in the day, Van called us up to speak after President Obama’s interview with David Simon had ended. Jessica and I looked at each other and said, “No pressure”—­after all, we were only speaking after the most popular man in the world outside of Michael Jordan. To cap it all off, not long after the summit we were invited to the White House, on September 18, 2015. * Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 66 * * 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 67 Think about this, my dear son. I had been let out of prison in 2010 and told that I’d be back in six months. Now I was slated to go to the White House just five years later. For a brief second, I thought of the guard who’d said I’d be back, but his prejudice wasn’t worth concentrating on. I had overcome his hatred so many times already. What I could not overcome was the cruel rigidity of the barriers postincarcerated people face every single day. I would have never imagined that my first visit to the White House would leave me standing outside in the sweltering Washington, D.C., heat, embarrassedNand disappointed.

Out there in the swelter I was texting back and forth with Nisha Anand and Alex Gudich from our #cut50 team; they were feverishly working to help me gain access while doing their best to keep me calm. Meanwhile, no matter how much I encouraged him to go ahead without me, Matt Haney refused to go inside; instead, he stood by my side. That was a true friend. Van was inside delivering his remarks on a panel hosted Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 67 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f68 shaka senghor by Angie Martinez, a musician and host at New York’s Power 105.1 FM radio station. When Van finished speaking, White House officials finally sent several staff members outside to get me. As soon as I walked into the room, everyone stared at me. I’d been kept outside for so long in the hot sun that I was sweating profusely, but my discomfort cracked when the room broke into applause and hoots and hollers. Van took me to a quieter area where people were waiting to go into the back to meet the president, and when he left, I realized I was alone with Angie Martinez.

I felt naked and alone standing there, waiting for my turn to meet the president. But I had come this far, and I managed to relish the moment. After my first parole denial in late 2008, the hope Obama spoke about in his campaign had sustained me through the storm of delayed freedom. His resilience and grace under fire were keys to leadership I had incorporated into my life. My mind ran across all the ways the interaction might go: Would the president be cordial, or would he be curious, as so many others were? Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 68 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 69 But before I could meet him, he was called to the podium to give his remarks. I went and took a seat in the front row to listen. He talked about his experience of being the first sitting president to go inside a prison and how he believed everyone deserved a second chance. It was surreal sitting there listening to the United States’ president talking about men and women who had had experiences similar to mine. “I had second chances,” he said. “In some cases, I had resources or I was in an environment in which when I made a mistake as a teen, that I could recover from it. And these young people didn’t have any margin for error.” ION Ttoo, U I was moved by Obama’s words.

OT N Six months later, on March 31, 2016, we were invited back. That time I breezed through security. I was later told that the policy had been changed based on my experience the first time. I have no idea if that’s true or not, but I’ll take it. For the second time in a year, I came just short of meeting President Obama. (By the time I arrived, he’d been called away on presidential business.) It was a bit of a letdown, but I salvaged what would otherwise have been a disappointing visit by photobombing the White House with pictures of my Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 69 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f70 shaka senghor memoir. I put the book all around the place and took a load of photos of it. That was a small part of my legacy for you, Sekou: your father had taken his work to the center of the country’s political life and had created a memorial of it, right there amid the paintings and the flowers and the hallways where so many important people had trodden. Who goes from living in the big house to photobombing the White House in a matter of six years? Your dad, that’s who.

But I wasn’t going to be disheartened by that day. I was still a firm believer that positive thinking attracts positive outcomes, so I continued to think about what the first handshake with the first Black president would be like. Nearly a year later, I would finally find out. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 70 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 71 * * * In February 2017, just shy of a year since Writing My Wrongs had come out, I was helping my publishers prepare a marketing strategy for the paperback edition. The hardcover had appeared on the New York Times bestseller list—­imagine that, Sekou. When I got the call from my agent telling me the news, I felt outside of myself. I’d written in my journal years earlier about the things I wanted to achieve as a writer. Holy shit, I thought—­that dream was now real. I felt validated; not only did my words matter, my life mattered, too.

The morning after the party, I went with Ben and Felicia to attend a talk he was giving. En route we stopped at an undisclosed location where Ben and Felicia were to meet Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Obama. As I waited outside, Felicia texted me to come join them. We walked briskly down a long hallway, and when I turned a corner, there was President Obama. He was taller than I’d imagined, and he Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 71 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f72 shaka senghor broke out into his trademark huge smile. We exchanged the universally understood “Black nod,” which Black people who don’t know each other but know each other always share. “So I heard you got a book,” he said. “Yes, Mr. President,” I said. “That is true. Unfortunately, I don’t have one with me today.” (Of course, secretly I was kicking myself because I didn’t actually have a copy on me—­ for about the only time ever!) “Oh, so the president can’t get a copy?” he said, laughing.

Obama offered hope to several generations through his words and courage in the face of adversity and doubt. He never shrank himself based on his race or his upbringing. When I think of the “dream” Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., described in his most famous speech, I can’t help but think that it looks something like former president Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama. I also can’t help but think that it looks something like working alongside Van, Matt Haney, Jessica Jackson, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 72 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 73 and many others who strive tirelessly to improve lives in real ways every day. This is the hope I bequeath you, my son. Hatred is everywhere and always will be, but there’s one thing that can defeat hatred, and that’s hope. When you write your own narrative, write it from a place of hope; fill it with optimism and opportunity and a sense that everything is possible. Don’t think of roads that dead-­end. Think of endless tracks across a beautiful space, like a spaceship heading out into who knows what. Hope is not some vague, soft-­focus dream; it’s a muscular, powerful antidote to hate.

It’s a good lesson to learn. It’s easy to think that you have to come down on one side or another of an issue when in fact, real strength comes in being able to see all parts of the puzzle. For many people, being in a nuclear family—­ mother and father and children all living in the same place, the relationship of the parents intact—­is the be-­all and end-­all of what is considered “normal.” And for many people, “normal” is the ultimate thing Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 75 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f76 shaka senghor to strive for. You’ve seen this in school, for example: kids who are “different” can be picked on or worse; no one wants to stand out; no one wants to be considered “other.” And the nuclear family seems so normal. It’s the way of biology and history, two people joining together to raise a child in the same home. Your experience has been different, of course, ever since you’ve been able to remember. You were three when your mother and I could no longer stay together in a romantic relationship. Your mother has spoken about how hard the breakup was, and I felt it deeply, too.

Your mother has spoken openly about the violence she experienced as a child. When your mother was twelve years old, her father held a pistol to her mother’s head; your Gigi pleaded with that man and managed to break free before he fired. But though the bullet missed, your mother’s family was never the same; your mother would never be the same, either. It was hard for her to trust her parents, so she hid in her books and in her education. But she’s resilient, and she decided to Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 76 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 77 make sure that when she was old enough to raise a child, the experience would be different, so different; and so it has been. In my case, the end of our family as I’d known it came in 1983. I remember it as though it were yesterday. I was eleven years old, standing with my father in the basement of our home on the east side of Detroit. Tears ran down his face as he stuffed albums into bright blue and orange milk crates. Just moments earlier he and my mother had sat my siblings and me down to inform us that they were separating and calling it quits. It still hurts, all these years later.

TRI S I D fresh out of solitary, a guy with a murder conviction who was OR F T still so traumatized by NO what had happened in his life, a man in the midst of nineteen years of incarceration, much of it in solitary confinement. I was angry and hurt. Some days I couldn’t see the future; it was like a gray light in a gray sky. Nevertheless, your mother saw something in me that I maybe hadn’t even fully seen in myself by that point—­a capacity to love. I truly don’t know how she saw it. What she did takes an incredible belief in humanity, and in possibility, in care, and love. All the things that she and I have tried to pass on to you. This is how we did it: For four years, we wrote letters, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 77 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f78 shaka senghor shared phone calls and visits, and did whatever we could to help build an unshakable bond, one that would endure the rigors of life on the outside. Those were our lifelines. Together we battled the system, a system that put me in solitary without cause and denied my parole two years in a row. She was a poet, a dreamer, a visionary. She was beautiful, with a PhD; I was handsome, with a GED. We started a company together and made big plans to live the happiest life possible. It was the love story dreams are made of. Together we believed that we could right the wrongs of our parents, and I could be the father I had always hoped I could be. N TIOrelationship was conU Eventually I was released.

I had toRadjust O F T your mother alongside NO me; some nights I woke up in a deep sweat, a deep panic, before drifting back off to sleep knowing I was no longer in a cell. There were so many new things for me to learn and appreciate. I spent the first few weeks being tutored by your mother about the modern world I now lived in. Your mother helped me expand my palate beyond the hamburgers and chicken wings I’d mostly consumed since I came home. I even had to relearn how to drive; she went with me when I had my first driver’s test. She had to bear with me as I worked out how to be comfortable in public spaces. In a way, your mother was as much my guardian as my romantic Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 78 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 79 partner. I had spent two decades in a cave; your mother had always lived free in a world that trundled along as normal, a place in which changes came organically, not all in a rush once the doors of a prison swung shut. When you were born, our lives became centered around you, our beautiful boy. I remember when we first brought you home—­it was the best feeling in my life. Your mother and I worked together, collaborated, supported each other. She took the morning shift; I took nights. It was the most magical time. And then it all changed. I knew your mother was planning to go back to work, but I’d been subconsciously avoiding the ION T U reality of it in my mind. OneIB morning she came in really R T excited. “Today’s the day!” DIS she said. “Aren’t you excited that R FObe able to build a bond?” I tried to feel it, you and SekouTwill O N saying “Yes, I’m ecstatic!

I tried to be positive, NO couldn’t tell your mother that, so instead I said, “Hey, go off and have a dope day.” And I was left with you, Sekou, and I was terrified—­a thirty-­eight-­year-­old child in charge of a baby. I can see now that your mother was trying to foster the trust that’s necessary for parents to coexist—­she was trusting me with our most precious gift, and she was trying to help me build the foundation for what’s important in this portal we call parenthood. But no, I wasn’t ready; and yes, I was afraid. By the time you were three, our relationship had become Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 79 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f80 shaka senghor unhinged. There were lots of reasons: post-­traumatic stress disorder from my brutal incarceration; the damage done in my time before I went to prison, a different but real kind of PTSD; baggage from your mother’s previous relationships; my inexperience in any kind of adult romantic relationship—­ all these things undid the magic of what we’d built behind the walls of a prison. Sometimes freedom is the hardest thing to navigate, especially if you haven’t known it as an adult. The loving relationship we had built was now being dismantled bit by bit and word by word. We argued often—­we said mean things, things we could never take back. We ION T behaved as well as we could in your IBUpresence, but the poisonR T ous things we said in private DIS could never be unsaid. R FOour romantic relationship broke, we never But even though OT N wavered in our love for you, Sekou. In fact, we are proud of the parenting we’ve done.

TRI S I D I have to face the reality On one side, your motherRand O F T of raising a Black boy NOin a society that says that Black boys, Black bodies, and Black lives can only be seen as profitable or disposable. We see that everywhere we look—­there are just a few things you’re allowed to be according to the bullshit media. As far back as I can remember, the depiction of Black males in the media and on TV has been that of a thug or a rogue. The best we could hope for—­and what kind of best is this?—­was that we’d be cast as the Black police chief giving the two white cops twenty-­four hours to once again become the heroes and solve the case. Rarely do we see Black heroes who aren’t adorned in basketball, football, or baseball jerseys. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 80 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 81 Nor do we see the everyday heroes—­the Black fathers who are just doing their best to get by in America. Luckily, during the mid-­eighties we started to see a bit of a shift with shows like The Cosby Show and Family Matters, which depicted professional, educated Black people. But even then, they were the exception to the rule. Today we’re starting to see more representation, though we have a long way to go. We have to be careful of these one-­dimensional narratives. We’re not monolithic. You can be an athlete who’s also an entrepreneur, a rapper who’s a businessman. You can be Nas, who raps and is also an investor in Ring. N You can be Maurice IO T Ashley, the first Black chess grandmaster. You could be Neil IBU R T deGrasse Tyson. You can DISbe an accountant if you really like R FO spreadsheets that much. You can be you, whatever that turns OT N out to be. Your mother and I wanted to raise a boy to be free to be N part whatever he wants to be, just as boys from the privileged TIO U B of America take as their birthright. It’sRwhat T I we have wanted S I D and so we work toward for you from the beginning, R Sekou, O F T that. We have created NO a space for healing, transformation, intimacy, and the possibilities of a world in which parents who are no longer together can openly show one another affection, support, caring, and love publicly, in a way that honors the relationship we have with you. Even more important, we need to be the power that supports each other in all those vulnerable moments, so that you grow up knowing that even if your parents don’t live together, their greatest moments in tandem and apart are with you. This can be true for all parents whose relationships have faltered. When the adults disagree, they can work things out themselves in private; but Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 81 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f82 shaka senghor the children must be sanctified by no wavering of love, no outward signs of distress. Co-­parenting is not only a choice that honors what’s best for us, it’s a choice that honors the best of who we are as parents. We don’t always have the answers, but we know that we can always count on each other. We talk often about the things that we know will impact your life; we check in with each other about your feelings; we inform each other about doctor visits and school meetings; on occasion, we just spend time together with you. And we never bad-­mouth each other in front of you. We even conspired to surprise you on your ION T ninth birthday with a businessIall BUyour own (your own affirR T IS that we invested in equally.

Here’s one of those moments when co-­parenting works N for us. One day, I came to pick you up from school—­ TIO you were U B in first grade. As I was waiting, another TRI parent walked up S I DShaka, I saw Oprah Winfrey to me and excitedly said, “Hey, OR F T give a shout-out to you NO on CNN last night.” I was mortified, because I could already imagine that she’d tell another parent who’d tell another parent and then they’d look me up and discover that I had been in prison for murder. And then a child of one of those parents would overhear the conversation and they would, as children can do, come to school and bully you with that knowledge. It was almost too upsetting to bear, so I knew that I had to call your mother. She just said, “You have to have the talk.” I agreed and told her I would record it for her, so she could fill in any gaps if necessary. I took you home that day, and as you were getting ready for bed that night, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 82 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 83 we talked for half an hour—­remember? I told you about why I had gone to prison and I listened to what you said. It was one of the hardest but most important conversations I have ever had. Eventually, we called your mom so we could do our nightly ritual—­she offers her prayers, and we do our affirmations. As your parents, we wanted you to know you are powerful, thoughtful, kind, and magical, despite what you might hear when you returned to school the following day. So that night after school and our difficult conversation—­and every night—­we intoned together, “I’m great.NI’m awesome. I’m O TII’m U amazing. I’m thoughtful. I’m loving. caring. I’m funny.

New atrocities hit us every day, week, month, and year, and it can be too easy to forget the details of what has happened as this rolling, endless litany of assaults piles onto our backs day after day. So let me make a memorial of just four incidents in the last two months. What is striking about these four Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 85 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f86 shaka senghor incidents is that they only partially show the range of what you might face as you grow up. On February 23, 2020, a young Black man, Ahmaud Arbery, was jogging in a Georgia neighborhood when two white men—­one, a former Georgia cop—­decided to chase him down in a truck and shoot him dead. A third white man filmed the murder and was subsequently alleged to have been involved. Let’s be clear, my dear son: Arbery was jogging. He wasn’t, as those racists alleged, a suspect in neighborhood robberies, nor was he stealing anything from a nearby building site. He was jogging, as he often did in the neighborhood in which he ION T lived. For that, he was murdered. IBU R T IS Breonna Taylor, a twenty-­six-­ Then, on March 13,D2020, R FO professional working hard in our panyear-­old BlackTEMT O N demic, was asleep in bed in Louisville, Kentucky, when a gang of plainclothes drug cops broke into her home allegedly lookN ing for a suspected drug dealer who was already TIO in custody U B elsewhere. When Breonna’s partner fired TRIa shot in self-­defense, S I D twenty rounds, eight of the police indiscriminately unloaded OR F T her. Words like “suspects” were which hit Breonna, killing NO used to describe Breonna and her partner. It wasn’t until civil rights activists got involved that the narrative changed, but it will always be too late for Breonna Taylor. She was asleep; she was murdered for being asleep. Later, there were two separate incidents on the same day, May 25. One showed the toxicity of white privilege, and the other showed the violence that privilege believes is its right. First, a Black man, Christian Cooper, was enjoying a nature walk in an area of Central Park in New York City called the Ramble when he asked a white woman, Amy Cooper Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 86 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 87 (no relation), to leash her dog. His request was fair; the Ramble is not an area where dogs are allowed off leash, and her dog was threatening the birds Christian wanted to look at. If you can imagine a gentler pastime than bird-­watching, well, good luck—­but even in the most peaceful of moments, white privilege sees threat: Amy Cooper, incensed by Christian’s reasonable request, called 911 and pretended that her life was in danger. “There is a man, African American, . . . ​threatening me and my dog,” she told the dispatcher.

Since the video of that murder went viral, the country has erupted in frustration and anger. People have taken to the streets to protest, but let’s pause for a moment to remember: in the weeks before George’s murder, heavily armed white men and women took to the streets across the country to protest the stay-­at-­home orders during the pandemic. They were allowed to protest as they pleased, with minimal police oversight. When protests began after the murder of George Floyd, the police response was huge, militarized, and violent. One officer in New York Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 87 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f88 shaka senghor City told a protester she was a stupid fucking bitch before violently pushing her ten feet across the street to the ground, sending her to the hospital. There have been baton charges, rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper pellets, and ­curfews—​a militarized offensive aimed at terrorizing us once again into silence, into remembering our place. This is the country in which you’re being raised. Black bodies can be murdered, threatened with murder, or assaulted, with impunity. The Black body is not considered fully, or even partially, human. And the key way this is brought home to bear, again and again, is via two simple words: “Stop resistION T ing.” IBU R T IS told, the magic phrase that, That’s what we’re D always R FOofficers free rein over their subject. Any once uttered,Tgives O N movement—­any—­after those two words seems to be a good enough excuse to visit violence upon the person who appears to N be, in the words of the officer, resisting. But it extends TIO beyond U B our interactions with police officers. Black TRI people are expected S I D not to resist in all walks of life. If we argue, we’re confrontaOR F T tional. If we stick upO N for ourselves, we’re pushy. The trope of the “angry Black,” especially Black women, is pervasive. We resisted in prison. In the summer of 1995 at the Michigan Reformatory, there were two prison officers who constantly bullied us and harassed us on the yard. They would steal our possessions, throw us up against a wall, even use choke holds on us. We couldn’t abide it any longer, but what could we do? If we’d gone after the two officers, it would have been an excuse for the guards in the towers to start shooting. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 88 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 89 Eventually, various organizations—­gang leaders and religious leaders and everyday guys—­held meetings to decide what we’d do about the men. Most believed that the only way to fix the issue was to be violent. But that would have gotten us nowhere, except maybe dead on the yard ourselves. Instead, we examined the prison rules. We were allowed to meet in groups of six and no more to exercise, but it didn’t say how many groups of six were allowed. So what we did was to organize the entire yard—­three hundred men—­into groups of six. Each group did a different workout exercise but counted at exactly the same cadence.NImagine that, fifty O TIsame U groups of six, all working out Iat the time in different B R T disciplines but to the same DIS call.

Officers came rushing out and down from the gun tower, thinking it was the start of a riot or a rebellion. Then, just as quickly as we had assembled, we disassembled, going back to a throng of men. Our message was heard. Though a few of us were taken to segregation and some to the warden’s office, and some were even transferred to another prison, we had made our point. I have been asked many times whether or not I’ll join the protests currently happening in our country. I protested in Detroit after an attendant at a gas station killed a man who had questioned him over the price of condoms, of all Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 89 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f90 shaka senghor things. I took you to those uprisings. But now, with people being arrested and hit with batons, to join in on the streets now I would be putting my freedom at risk. I already have two felonies; a third would put me away forever. I know how important this moment is, and I want to take you out. But with such a threat to my freedom, I have to find other ways for us to resist. My task is to give you the right information to prepare for your coming battles. “Stop resisting.” These are the words our culture has for Black boys, men, and women when we are simply trying to ION T breathe, let alone rebel. We areItold BU to stop resisting by cops, R T yes, but also by more than DISjust cops—­by angry white women R O are told to stop resisting when protests FWe in Central Park. OT N erupt in the streets. We are told that we must be as peaceful as a church service, otherwise our resistance is “violent” or it’s N going against the memory of George Floyd. We’re TIO reminded U B that property is sacred, even when human TRI lives are not. S I D resisting,” as a kind of Cops use those two words, “Stop OR F T magical cloak behindO N which they feel free to do whatever they wish with the Black body in front of them. They shout the words at those they are arresting for no reason who have the temerity not to acquiesce to an unlawful order. Or they use them as a smoke screen for when a police officer is brutalizing a citizen. What it means is “Hey, I can cause you pain and discomfort first, but if you push back at that in the slightest way, you’re resisting, so I then have complete freedom to use your body as I wish.” Or “I can threaten your life with a gun or a choke hold or a knee to the neck, and if you don’t meekly give in to that pain, then you’re resisting, and I can Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 90 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 91 escalate to whatever degree I like.” You can be as passive as the officer wants you to be or as passive as a white woman in a park needs you to be, but if you are not cowed by the cloak of power he or she wields—­if you are not subdued in the way of the enslaved person—­then you are resisting, and they can do whatever they want to you until you stop resisting. How will a cop know that you’ve stopped resisting? There’s only one way to be truly sure. George Floyd stopped resisting. Walter Scott stopped resisting in South Carolina in 2015 when a cop pulled out a gun and made sure that he could never resist again. Eric Garner stopped resisting on a street ION T in Staten Island when he was pulled IBU to the ground in a choke R T ISsin of not going along completely hold and murdered forD the R FO It also happens in prison; innocent Black with his own abuse. OT N men on death row are just another brick in the edifice of state-­sanctioned murder. N So what am I to tell you, Sekou, if you’re Itold T O to “stop U B resisting when resisting”? Should you do so? Was EricRGarner T I S I D Was George Floyd resisthis life was ended by a choke R hold? O F T minutes a cop kept his knee on his ing for the more thanOnine N neck? Chris Cooper resisted in the most mundane of ways, and his life was thereafter in the balance. For years, the Black community has dealt with this injustice by “having the talk” with its young men. Even the mayor of New York City—­a man who has a Black son and who is in control of the police force—­said in 2014, “With Dante, very early on with my son, we said, ‘Look, if a police officer stops you, do everything he tells you to do, don’t move suddenly, don’t reach for your cellphone.’ Because we knew, sadly, there’s a greater chance it might be misinterpreted Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 91 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f92 shaka senghor if it was a young man of color.” The response by the police union? Its president said, “If this individual, who’s in charge of running this city, doesn’t have faith in his own son being protected by the NYPD, he may want to think about moving out of New York City completely. He just doesn’t belong here.” That’s right—­a father who dared name the reality of racism was threatened with being run out of town by his own police force. So am I to have this talk with you? Am I to tell you to not resist so that you might stay alive? I’m fed up with people asking me what I am going to tell ION T you to do if you are confrontedIB byUpolice. The reality is that R T there is nothing I can tell DISyou to protect you against a racist R O on breaking your back, kneeling on your cop who is hell-­ bFent OT N neck, or choking the life out of you; there’s nothing I can tell you about the slurs you’ll hear, the times you’ll be followed N or detained or questioned for merely being on TIOa street. So U B instead, I must out of necessity teachRyou T I how to physically S I D a thought so heartbreaking defend yourself. If you must die—­ OR F T the words—­I would rather you I don’t want to evenOwrite N died fighting back, because it is clear to me that complying to commands to stop resisting will end with you being carried away in a body bag. The poet Claude McKay wrote about this very thing in 1919: If We Must Die If we must die, let it be not like hogs Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot, While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 92 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 93 Making their mock at our accursèd lot.

None of these things makes me feel safe as a Black man, friend, or father in America—­in fact, nothing makes me feel safe. I am exhausted, just as our options are exhausted, yet there is a part of me that refuses to give up or give in. Meanwhile I will continue to ask myself tough questions, like: What can I do to make my son and other Black boys feel safe and empowered? What can I do to let them know they are loved? What can I do to eradicate the fear that they will die because of their blackness? What the fuck can I do? Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 93 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f94 shaka senghor It starts with this: resist. There is a proud history of resistance that you need to learn about and internalize and feed upon when you are called to act. As enslaved people we sabotaged tools, created the music of resistance, fled via the Underground Railroad. We stole our masters’ food and liquor and livestock; we fought against the forces of racism in the Civil War and after. We fought back in the Red Summer riots in 1919, in Chicago and Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. We created sit-­ins and protests and freedom rides and boycotts throughout the civil rights era. We have been Harriet Tubman and Malcolm X and Rosa Parks and Moses Wright, Emmett ION T Till’s great-­uncle, who stood up IBinUa court in the deep South R T IS man, accusing him of murderin 1955 and pointed to D a white R FO ing his nephew. In prison we organized resistance, such as the OT N cadence trick in Michigan. We have created Million Man and Woman marches and Black Lives Matter. N This is resistance. TIO U B So many men and women have done TRI their part; now it’s S I D callout, the cancel, or the up to you to do yours. ForgetRthe O F T shaming culture. This NO is heart and gut check time. This is a time for us to reimagine collectively what it means to stand for something. This is your moment to exercise a higher way of seeing and believing in the best that is us. This is a moment for clarity of vision, for good people to listen to one another in a spirit of openness. We have people on the front lines and people operating in the back. Their efforts are equally important. Resistance looks different to everyone; all should be honored. This is a visceral time of reckoning, not only with who we are but with who we can become. Never diminish someone’s Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 94 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 95 efforts because they aren’t the same as yours. There is no greater than or less than, it all counts. In this moment, and in the future moments when we’re called to respond, we have to love up our people to a state of active engagement. Above all, this is your calling as a young Black man in America: no longer should you not resist, and no longer will I abide by telling you to do so. And no longer will I hold out the expectation that you must wait on the hope that those you deal with will treat you fairly. As Malcolm X said, “I believe in the brotherhood of man, all men, but I don’t believe in brotherhood with anybody who doesn’tNwant brotherhood IO Tright, U with me.

The first step in resistance is to aver that you are indeed human. Those who lose sight of this truth will seek to deny you due process and fair treatment on the streets and in the courts and will try to jail you whether or not you have committed a crime. Resist; resist the narrative that you are not a boy, that you are not a man, that you are not human. I’m tired, Sekou—­I’m tired of all this. I’m tired because Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 95 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f96 shaka senghor I know that the list of murders of body and spirit that I put into this letter will already be out of date by next week, next month, next year—­perhaps by tomorrow. Somewhere tonight, even, somewhere in America, a racist cop will violently grab a Black person and will hurt him or her physically, will treat him or her as nonhuman, will tell him or her that he or she may not drive, cross the street, walk, or even sleep. That person will have perhaps had the talk with his or her parents, and will know that he or she should acquiesce, but the invisible chains clank and taunt, and the slightest movement—­the inability of a human being to ever fully be a ION T statue—­will seem like resistance to the culture, and the vioIBU R T lence will intensify as the DISculture screams, “Stop resisting!” R FO And then there is no stopping what will come.

For me, it began have known a lot ofDboth FOR a neighbor attempt to molest me early: from T having O N to watching my brothers go off to a boys’ home to lying alone in a hospital bed after being shot, I have N known what it means to be completely alone. TIOThere U B will be times in your life when you’re TRI alone—­very S I alone—­and you need to R beD able to deal with it. O F Tconfinement for a large portion I was in solitary NO of my time in prison. In total it came to about seven years, but there was one stretch when I did four years straight. From October 1999 to March 2004, I woke up every morning inside a six-­by-­nine-­foot solitary confinement cell. For five days a week, for years, I got to leave my cell for only one hour a day (and let’s not even think about the prison’s policy that kept me in solitary on twenty-­four-­hour lockdown for two days a week). Isolation is inhumane; Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 97 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f98 shaka senghor it causes profound damage to human beings. No one leaves there without deep scars; no one. Many others have written eloquently about isolation and how damaging it can be. Anne Frank, in her famous diary, wrote that one particular day, Sunday, was dreadful to her: I wander from one room to the next, down the stairs and back up again and feel like a songbird that has had its wings torn off and flies against the bars of its cage in total darkness. “Outside, fresh air and laughter,” a voice inside me screams; I don’t even try to answer anyION T more, I lie down on a divan and sleep in order to shorten IBU R T IS terrible fear too, because there the time, the silence,Dthe R O is no question T Fof killing them. NO I understand that so well; a sense that one’s very essence, N the wings of the songbird, has been lost to the sense TIO of aloneU B ness. And the voices in your head don’tRjust T I talk when you’re S I DAnne Frank, it’s amazing to isolated—­they scream. Reading OR F T think that though our NOoutward experiences were so different and took place at such different times in history, our shared sense of despair makes us siblings in pain. This is what isolation does: it creates a family—­no family you’d ever want to be in but a family all the same—­gathered around a hearth of torture and fear and a mind in turmoil. Nelson Mandela was part of that family, too. He spent eighteen years on Robben Island, usually in a cell just eight feet by seven feet. Sometimes he’d be placed in solitary for something as simple as reading newspaper clippings. His times in isolation were as routine as they were without cause. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 98 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 99 Twice a year, he was allowed to write one letter and have one visitor. In his autobiography he wrote: The authorities believed that isolation was the cure for our defiance and rebelliousness. . . . I found solitary confinement the most forbidding aspect of prison life. There was no end and no beginning; there is only one’s own mind, which can begin to play tricks. The greatest threat of isolation is that your mind can lose its bearings. We forget how interactionsNwith other people O TIcan U and with the natural world around us work to anchor our B I R T IS imaginations and our D thoughts—­ without those things, we R FOadrift, our minds like albatrosses flying can be set entirely OT N across vast oceans, unable to land to take our bearings. In solitary I was anxious, stressed out, and deeply N of the depressed. A lot of that had to do with the uncertainty TIO U B situation: I never knew when I was going TRI to be released back S I D so every time an officer or into the general prison population, OR F T counselor approached NOmy door, my body would tense up and my palms would sweat. “Is this the day they are going to tell me the nightmare is over?” I’d wonder. I eventually realized that I was trying to control something I had no control over, a labor that only brings more suffering. Now, you won’t ever have to face solitary confinement in a prison, God willing, so you might be wondering why I’m telling you about all this. Well, isolation comes in many forms. For one, we’ve all suffered through the social distancing of the pandemic. But long after the lockdowns lift, there will be times, even in the best of years, when you’ll find yourself very Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 99 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f100 shaka senghor alone. Perhaps you’ll be traveling solo; perhaps a relationship you’re in will end; perhaps you’ll go to college and find it hard to make friends; perhaps you’ll be old one day, and your social circle will contract to just a few people. Maybe you’ll have countless friends but still feel alone. A lot of people feel that way—­surrounded by loved ones but unable to connect, to feel truly seen and understood. All these things can cause a feeling of isolation, of loneliness, of dislocation. You may feel as though you don’t have your feet on the ground; it’s like a heavy weightlessness; it feels like being adrift but at the same time sluggish. It’s like ION T being anchored by a malignantIforce BU you can’t see. R T IS and I want to draw you a road This is a dangerousD feeling, R map out of it.T FO NOthing to understand is that feelings of isolation The first become worse if you can’t see a way out. For me, that hapN pened every time I was not let back into the general TIO populaU B tion. I would watch other men get out, TRI or I’d head up to a S I D People told me I would hearing for release, only to beRdenied. O F T be there forever, andO N I started to believe it. Whatever the reason for your isolation, it can leave you feeling as though you’ll never love again, you’ll never make friends again, the terror you feel now will never subside. But that’s the first thing to understand, the great trick of being alive: things change. Nothing stays the same forever. Sometimes we might wish it to, when things are going good. Alas, everything changes, and that’s a positive thing. So in those moments of deep isolation, please know that eventually something will come along to change the situation. Remember how I used to think that I’d never get out of solitary? Well, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 100 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 101 this morning you and I had breakfast together in our house in Los Angeles. Everything changes. But you don’t have to wait for things to change, either—­ you can make change happen. I had to learn that the hard way. When I was in isolation in Wayne County Jail, I often found myself listless, without energy. I discovered that my thoughts and my actions were the only two things I could control; and once I understood that, I was better able to stop “watching the cockroaches” and start making progress. Screw when the prison administration was going to release me; my job was ION T to focus my energy on becoming the best version of myself. IBU R T When I finally understood DIS that, I realized that I could turn R FOa space of enlightenment, creativity, and my prison cellTinto O N higher learning. I studied a different subject every hour. I meditated. And for entertainment, I followed the chess games N of the men around me. Because we weren’t allowed TIO to have U B chess sets, the men would draw a boardRon T I the back of a noteS I D as chess pieces, calling out pad and use small pieces of paper OR F T the moves accordingO N to the letters and numbers corresponding to the squares. And I started writing. None of that was easy, and it took a long time. But I committed to the belief that I would come out on the other side of the pain healthy and whole, and I was able to do it. One of the first things I did was to keep a journal. I would write on the backs of envelopes, scraps of paper, anything I could get my hands on. Noting down your experiences is the first way—­and sometimes the most powerful—­to make sense of the world around you and gain a little control over Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 101 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f102 shaka senghor it. Perspective is crucial in all that you do. Take time to dig into your feelings about the events of each day, even if it’s just for a few moments. Doing so will help you sort out what’s important about what happened, and what you can let go. When we first moved to Koreatown, at nighttime you and I would talk. Sometimes we’d stand at the windows in your bedroom, which had floor-­to-­ceiling glass, and just take in the beautiful LA landscape. There were lights everywhere, twinkling dots of energy all the way up to the dark hills. We would play a game. “What do you see when you look out the window?” I’d ION T ask you. IBU R T “Ralph’s,” you’d say, DIorS “McDonald’s. Stoplights.” Then R FOwhat do you see?” you’d say, “Daddy, OT N Well, I saw millions of ideas. Somebody had to develop the cement, the screws, the blocks of concrete, the hinges on N doors, the clasps on windows, the locks, the light TIO poles, the U B street signs, the paint for the roads, the TRI little black plastic S I cap that goes over the valveRinDa car wheel. So many ideas O TF made real. O N And I’d say to you, “You see those people on the corner? Do you think they see what I see? Probably not, right? They’re not up here so high. Does that mean that this world doesn’t exist? This world exists. They just can’t see it.” You can see the vastness of anything if you’re looking for it. When I was in prison, I longed for such conversations. When all you have is time to think, your perspective gets bent like a road after an earthquake. It distorts your sense of what is crucial and what is just noise. Things that would otherwise roll off your back can grow into hundred-­pound weights. I Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 102 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 103 remember being filled with rage; rage that too often made me feel as though I’d been forgotten. The first time I sat down to write something in my journal, it felt like an act of meditation. I wrote freely with no editing, no judgment, just words, and felt an overwhelming sense of joy. You know that excitement when you meet a new friend? That was me, meeting myself. Writing gave me energy—­ sometimes I would do push-­ups immediately afterward or even dance—­and it gave me a sense of celebration in a terrible place. I would wait till late at night and write standing up by the door, utilizing the merest sliver of light shining through ION T the crack at the edge. I would write IBU when I was angry or sad R T S bit of hope to set in. or even when I allowedDa Itiny R O was the last time you had an honest FWhen Answer this: OT N conversation with yourself or processed that one thing that doesn’t seem to go away? If you’re honest in your journal, N you’ll be able to answer that question by sayingIO T “Every day.” U B Because a journal doesn’t let you hide;RitIwould be like cheatT S I D ing at golf or something. Journaling, like meditating, is a OR F T wonderful way of quieting NO the voices in your head. We all have those nagging voices: questioning who we are, what we stand for, what we want to be—­and worse: fixating on things that have gone wrong, people who have let us down, the moments in our lives that hurt so much that we can’t let go. Back in prison, meditating felt like a foreign land. I was nineteen, and let’s just say that meditation had not previously been part of my life—­in fact, I’m not sure I’d even heard the word up to that point. I knew this much, though: my thoughts were running fast, an endless ticker like the one at the bottom of ESPN or CNN. The loop of thoughts was Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 103 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f104 shaka senghor endless, and I didn’t know how to open the door to let the thoughts out. One day, I got a pamphlet about how meditation could help me cope with my new reality. I sat down with the pamphlet and tried to take in the lessons on how to breathe and how to empty your mind. When I started feeling anxious and the voices in my head became too insistent, I would lie on my bunk and focus on my breathing. I would inhale for a count of five and slowly exhale for a count of five. On the inhale, I tried to bring in a kind of liberating energy, a sense of hope and possibility; on the exhale, I told myself to release all the ION T U counterproductive and damaging It was hard in the IBthoughts.

But once I let those things go and began to understand that the world wasn’t against me—­or if it was, I couldn’t change it—​I arrived at a place where those random thoughts were replaced with affirmations. I was letting in the beautiful light and dismissing the muddy things; it was an incredible therapy for me. In the end, of course, people need people. Humans crave contact, touch, and engagement, and they need to be seen. I was in prison, don’t forget, so emails and texts were out of the Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 104 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 105 question; and it wasn’t enough to just wait for a phone call a few times a week. I had to do something to forge connections outside those evil walls, so I did what people have been doing since they invented papyrus (and before, if you count cave art): I wrote, and I wrote to people. Now, given that you’re growing up with a little computer in your pocket, you’ll probably think I’m some kind of dinosaur for suggesting that you write letters. Go ahead, call me a stegosaurus so we can move on. But letters literally saved my life, Sekou. Saved. My. Life. Because it wasn’t just that I forged connections with people outside the prison and beyond ION T my experience—­though that inIand BUof itself is one of the best R T arguments for writing—­ DInSo, it was more than that. The letR FOinto who I was and understand the forces ters helped meTdive O N that had led me to do the things I’d done. I used to think I was a bad kid, instead of a kid who’d had bad things happen N to him. I also used to think I was worthy only ofIO T the negatives U B my life had given me—­but writing helped TRI me see that I was S I D worthy of other things, like fatherhood, love, and success, and OR F T one day, freedom. When NO you force yourself to compose a sentence, you have to have a clear pathway ahead of you. Writing is not just about the sentence structure and the grammar and the spelling; it’s about creating a way forward in your mind, creating a sense of purpose, fulfilling a promise to yourself. Also, think about receiving a letter—­is there anything better, truly? When you go to a mailbox and see your name on the outside of an envelope, it’s a whole world of magic waiting for you. The moment before you open it and all the questions that come: What will this person say? What will they tell me about themselves and about me? Will they still be angry? Will Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 105 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f106 shaka senghor they forgive? Will they admit they love me, or have they fallen out of love? Will they talk about a tree they saw or a bird or a coyote in a canyon that paused to look? Will there be a joke, a funny story, a little drawing, perhaps? This is why many days in your lunch box you’ll find a note from me. Sometimes I tell you how much I love the details of you—­the way you smile, the way you laugh, the way you get so excited over a new pair of sneakers or when your mind hits on a new thing. Other times, I write you to explain more fully something that’s come up in a previous conversation. Letters are magical because they can conjure upN a world beyond the IO T one you can see. You want to Igo to the deepest part of the BU R T ocean? Space? The Amazon DISjungle? Letters can magically take R FO After we moved into our new house, you you on that journey. OT N even put one of my lunch box letters on your wall, so that “every time you leave, you can read it.” N Letters are magical objects, and I urge youIO T to both send U B them—­lots of them—­and ask to receive TRI them. Unlike email S I Dtechnology will be, letters or texts or whatever the next OR F T remain; they are solid, NO like the trees from which the paper they’re written on is made. You can look back on them years and years from now and see who you were and who you wanted to be. You’ll see more clearly who the person writing to you was back then and who he or she wanted to be. You can write to your younger self or the old man you will one day be, using letters as checkpoints to track your development. Heck, you might even create a great passion: the letters your mother and I shared still crackle with the urgency of passion and love. Even though it didn’t work out between us, those letters are Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 106 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 107 proof, unmitigated evidence that a love existed, and it was real, and it made you, Sekou. I went to prison at nineteen with a murder conviction; I came out decades later a writer. I don’t want you to think that the process of that change was easy, but I do think that the isolation I felt led me to move more inward, to stop beating up the world around me, and to focus on what I could do to be a better person. What flowed from that is my writing career, something that has meant everything to me. Now, I don’t know if you want to follow me in this; it’s not like a bakery or a farm or a dental practice where the kids take over ION T U the family business. Writing is IaBsolitary thing, and it’s hard, R T and I don’t know if you’ll DISeven want to do such a thing. I do R FObooks, and I couldn’t be prouder of you for know that youTlove O N that. Maybe it will lead you one day to try to write your own. Maybe you’ll write about your father or your mother or your N extended family; maybe you’ll write about theIworld T O around U B you, the culture you live in, or the discrimination you face; TRI S I D sports, or music. The or maybe you’ll write about Rpolitics, O F T world is open to you O N in ways that it wasn’t for me when I was your age. When I was a kid, Black children didn’t have voices; it was better to be seen than heard. Now you’re privileged to have a household that considers your presence as sacred. We adore your voice. I happen to think that everyone should and can write a book. It doesn’t have to be published. It’s funny: unlike weekend painters, everyone who writes a book thinks it deserves to be in bookstores. But writing a book should be about the process, the effort of thought and construction in the service Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 107 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f108 shaka senghor of honesty. No one has the one truth; but trying to write your truth is the greatest gift you can give yourself. It doesn’t necessarily need to be available in bookstores. Maybe it’s just for you. That would be enough. The key thing about writing, though, be it a letter, a journal, or a book, is this: Be kind to yourself, and give yourself permission to be imperfect. The most important thing is getting that story out of your head and onto paper; it’s not about bigging yourself up, letting yourself off, or performing for a crowd. You have to write to work out who you are. So many ION T of us have no idea who we are,Iand BUthe truth is that most of R T IS us are much harder onDourselves than we would ever be on R O someone else. T WeFforgive others so much quicker than we forO N give our own missteps. When you use writing as a tool to see yourself as others might, you’ll be amazed at what you find. N Sometimes in isolation, these inner efforts—­ TIOmeditating, U B journaling, writing—­are all well and good, TRI but you also need S I Dyour body as well as your to remember to do things with OR F T mind. By body I meanOexternal things, things that externalize N your inner process, things that get your actual blood flowing: running around the yard with your puppy, going on a walk, building something with your hands. Isolation and depression are bunkmates, trust me. And one of the best ways out of depression is to move through time and space. Serving time in solitary wasn’t easy. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever endured. There were days when the ghost of the past and the uncertainty of the future threatened to crush the little bit of hope I had of ever being free. But I knew Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 108 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 109 if I could get through the pain of those moments, I could come out on the other side. I can’t promise that you will go through life unscathed. You will lose loved ones, you will have your heart broken, you will break someone’s heart. You will have money, and you will lose it; you will have friends, and they will move away. But remember, my son: Each moment is all you really have. Even in isolation, each moment is new and dear and never to come again. Look inside every moment for its brilliance and shine. It’s there; you just have to look.

I have been thinking a lot about those decisions. Making the right choices is a lot harder than picking A or B or C—­and picking the right path is one of the most important things you can ever do. It’s not easy; I’ve learned from my bad decisions, and no doubt I’ll make some more going forward—­everyone does. That’s just part of being alive.

Should I have just gone on with my life quietly and not decided to tell my story and sell books out of the back of a car and have to be public about the murder? What would my life have been if I’d taken the “easier” road, the road that says, “Keep quiet, get a job, forget your past”? But my experience has taught me that life is not like that, not a simple equation of this or that. There’s a poem by Robert Frost that you will no doubt be taught in school, because it Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 112 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 113 feels as though every poetry class at some point studies this poem. You might know its most famous lines already: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—­ I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. I don’t like this poem, and I don’t like the fact that it’s one of the few poems a lot of Americans know. I don’t like it because it sets up an either/or proposition.

But let’s slow down that wheel and stop awhile, here in the California sun, and consider each individual spoke. Each time you’re faced with a decision, think of the bicycle wheel; work hard to separate the spokes, the strands of a decision, so that you can think clearly about which one you want to choose. That must always be your thought process: How do I choose the right and the good? But there is something else you need to know, my boy. For young Black men, there are unseen spokes that the white Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 113 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f114 shaka senghor culture holds in reserve for you. I don’t mean white people; you will meet many good and true white people, just as you will meet Black people who don’t have your best interests at heart. But the culture, the culture into which I and your mother have given you breath, has a whole set of spokes that you won’t always be able to see: discrimination, a lack of opportunities, a sense that you can never measure up, all of it propagated by the school system, by grandparents who internalized white superiority and Black inferiority and handed them down to each subsequent generation, by media that know that fear of Black men in particularNsells newspapers—­ IO Twhen U that you must always hit a thousand everyone else can B I R T get by hitting .300.

We have been lynched; we have been beaten; our leaders have been killed; we have been incarcerated and spat on and kept from the lunch counter. We have simply wanted to eat as our brothers and sisters have eaten, and yet . . . ​this is the great curse of our place in white culture. I want you to grow up free from Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 114 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 115 the chains that have held so many of us back, but you can free yourself only if you know. And one thing to know is that there are spokes in the wheel that you can’t even see. I faced one such decision a few years ago, and in fact you made me make it. I was working for the Anti-­Recidivism Coalition, a nonprofit that helps women and men reenter society after incarceration—­in fact, I was its executive director. We were doing prison tours, helping people transition back to society, spending hours with newly released people talking about their experiences. We helped people get jobs in construction and firefighting and Hollywood, and we raised ION T U people unpack their a ton of money. But mostly weIBhelped R T IS members. That was the heaviest trauma, including someDstaff R FOand the most beautiful—­but I often felt part of the work—­ OT N we could never do enough.

And as much as I wanted to help those who were newly released, I knew that for my own sense of well-being I needed a break. It was a tough decision, but the importance of choosing happiness over prestige made it easy. It had been the perfect job for me, but it also had the possibility of being disastrous. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 115 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f116 shaka senghor I could never have made that decision without your love, Sekou; without your being present, aware, and deeply emotionally smart.

Jay, there was one time you cried that stands out for me. During one of our visits, I remember you getting really cranky, as toddlers will. You didn’t want to be consoled, but then you noticed a woman across the room, and you ran over to her, climbed up into her lap, and fell asleep. I wasn’t allowed to go get you from that stranger; it was so painful in a sense, but I gained comfort from watching how the Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 117 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f118 shaka senghor woman cradled you and wiped your tears away and rubbed your head until you fell asleep. That was the joy and sadness of visits. Not being able to pick you up was all sadness, but seeing you receive comfort for your tears? All joy. Sekou, you’ve seen me cry. The song “True Love” by Loaded Lux breaks me every time I hear it, and I’ve never hidden that from you. But this isn’t usually how it goes.

The world was different then; the first Covid-­19 infection in the United States had just been announced, but it was just one person, and we all went about our lives as though nothing was wrong. Wuhan, the city in China where the infection had started, had been on lockdown for just three days. By the end of 2020, more than 325,000 people in the United States had died of the illness, including my friend Marlowe Stoudamire, a brilliant Detroit-­ based entrepreneur and business developer. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 118 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 119 But that was all to come. That morning in LA, everywhere was hushed. Heavy clouds had rolled in off of the Pacific until they hung like a pall over the whole area, from Orange County to Malibu. The fog was thick. Voices barely carried. I imagined you up early at home with your mother, ready to face another happy day. I was starting to think about getting ready to attend the Grammys that evening. My stylist was about to arrive—­ imagine that, from being in prison to having my own stylist for the Grammys—­when I got a text from your mother. About thirty miles from our house, upNin the Malibu CanTonIOboard had crashed at U yon, a helicopter with nine people B RI IST around 9:45 a.m. SomeDmountain bikers had seen the impact R FO11:25, TMZ reported that one of the pasand called 911.TAt O N sengers on the chopper had been basketball star Kobe Bryant.

Kobe was forty-­oRne, T I his daughter just S I D had been extinguished in thirteen. In an instant, theirRlives O F T the fog of a Sunday morning. NO We heard the news and wept. Kobe was extraordinary not just for his basketball skills but for everything else. On top of his five NBA titles, two Olympic gold medals, and eighteen All-­Star Game appearances, he was a musician, an actor, a published author, a philanthropist, a businessman, a father, a husband. He stood for Black success and excellence. Seven months later, another extraordinary Black man died in our city: Chadwick Boseman. Boseman once said that the Marvel movies he had starred in—­with mostly Black Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 119 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f120 shaka senghor casts and Black directors—­had changed what it means to be “young, gifted, and Black.” But he had struggled with colon cancer for four long years, all the time still working, still raising money and awareness and helping our community and our country. He lost his fight on August 28, 2020. We heard the news and wept. About a year before Kobe died, on another Sunday, the rapper and entrepreneur Nipsey Hussle was standing outside his store, Marathon Clothing, just ten minutes south of our house in South LA. It was his community; in addition to the clothing store, he owned a burger joint, N a barbershop, and a IO T U in the neighborhood fish market nearby. He employed IBpeople R T IS jobs, and he once even gave shoes who otherwise couldn’tDget R FatOa local elementary school. to every student OT N Nipsey Hussle was a beacon of hope and a living example to all of us. He stood shining at the epicenter of hip-­hop’s N “get-­it-­how-­you-­live” ethos, a path to successIlaid T O down by U B Master P, P. Diddy, Jay-­Z, 50 Cent, Nas, TRI and many others S I Dhop, like their predecessors, before him. Those titans of hip-­ OR F T built their art out ofOpoverty, desperation, and street husN tling. The ethos said, “I will take the broken pieces of my circumstances and create something beautiful, powerful, and enduring.” It launched a cultural revolution that survived the War on Drugs and mass incarceration and created a voice for the voiceless. That so much of what they did was dismissed as glorifying violence only proved that they were onto something true and real. But that terrible Sunday, a man walked up to Nipsey’s clothing store with a gun. Nipsey was hit ten times and died. We heard the news and wept. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 120 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 121 One of Nipsey’s greatest posthumous gifts was that he restored to us that which we didn’t know we were missing. Days after he died, I talked to many brothers in person and via social media who expressed deep sorrow and admitted to having broken down in tears when they heard the news. For many, it was the first time they publicly shared their deepest sorrows, sadness, and tears. In a culture that suffocates or just plain denies our right to be tender and vulnerable, the reaction of those men was wonderful to behold. Their tears cleansed, nurtured, and normalized vulnerability for boys who had been taught to suppress their emotions so they ION T could survive. IBU R T Like Tupac’s and Biggie’s DIS before him, Nipsey’s death R FOus—­and for good reason. Like many of weighed heavy on OT N us, Nipsey could see beyond the circumstances of the hood he’d grown up in, past the straitjacket of his past misdeeds. N He refused to be locked in by ideas that limited TIO his imagiU B nation; he refused to keep his dreams TRIto himself. Instead, S I he concentrated on the idea R of D family, community, art, and O F T future on his terms. He NO made bold moves and took calculated risks; he stayed when others might have run (once you’re successful, there can be an undercurrent of danger to your success). The streets were a runway for him to soar and teach our children that they could transcend the clouds of their circumstances; it devastated us that those same streets would kill him. Nipsey’s death has forced us to examine ourselves in ways we hadn’t in a long time and to accept the complexities of our lives. Nipsey wasn’t perfect, but why do Black men—­and Black artists especially—­have to be perfect? They don’t have to be, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 121 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f122 shaka senghor and neither do you two. His very existence is proof that you can be the things you say in songs—­an incredible effort of turning a vision board into an action board. As just one of the many things he accomplished, remember that he organized a peace treaty in hoods across the nation, all so that our world is a little safer. From South Central LA to South Side Chicago, from Detroit to Oakland, the potential for giants to be awakened and enlightened is in place thanks to him. When Nipsey died, we wept just as my father’s generation had wept decades earlier, when we had lost Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Patrice Lumumba. But these ION T are often the only times that Black IBU men—­young Black men R T IS down their pain and weep. Only especially—­feel free toDlay R O killed are we able to express our feelings.

We don’t cry when someone in our family comes to us in need, when a friend’s clothes are in rags, or when our children are hungry. We don’t cry when a virus hits our community harder than any other. We don’t cry for so many reasons. Our heroes die, and it devastates us—­but what about the other deaths, the daily, ordinary deaths in our communities? Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 122 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 123 Perhaps we cried for George Floyd and Breonna Taylor; perhaps our tears fell for Trayvon Martin or Rayshard Brooks or Philando Castile. But the victims in our own communities, do we cry for them? And if not, why not? Have we become numb? Maybe that’s why each of these losses hits us so hard; they jar us out of our numbness. Think about Detroit. There were 275 homicides there in 2019 alone. By October 2020, there had been 261 homicides in Los Angeles this year. How can we be numb to these numbers? I was at Carson City Correctional FacilityNwhen we heard that IO This U Tupac Shakur had died. The news of death devastated the B I R T IS of “Dear Mama,” “California men at the prison. TheDsounds R FO az a Ridah” could be heard drifting Love,” and “Ambitionz OT N beneath the door of nearly every cell on the tier. The mood was somber, contemplative.

Nevertheless, we music, his stance on social issues, OR F T felt like coconspirators NO because we had lived the kind of life that Tupac and many other rappers rap about in their songs. We had lived it, and he had written about it, but it worked the other way around, too—­he had written about it, so some of us had lived it. Whatever the case, we felt responsible that morning in September 1996. We loved him because he had been so emotional, so vulnerable when he started out. Songs like “Brenda’s Got a Baby,” about a teenage mother who had gotten pregnant as the result of having sex with her cousin, brought home to me the sadness of your abandonment, Jay (not to mention that your Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 123 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f124 shaka senghor mother’s name is Brenda). No one else was writing like that about social issues, about personal issues, about the things that we lived and felt; we knew he’d come about it honestly, too. His family background had been one of resistance. His mother, Afeni, had raised him to think he was “the Black Prince of the revolution,” he said, and he’d been surrounded by activists and revolutionaries as a child. He knew what it meant to be Black in America: in a deposition he once said, “There are no Shakurs, black male Shakurs, out right now, free, breathing, without bullet holes in them or cuffs on his hands.

He was shot in a recording studio in New York City in November 1994, but a year earlier he had been accused of rape in a hotel room. Though he always denied involvement in the sexual assault, he was honest enough to admit that he hadn’t done anything to safeguard the woman involved. He was convicted and sent to a high-­security prison in upstate New York. From there, everything changed. Bailed out by Death Row Records, he came out of imprisonment with a Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 124 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 125 sense of rage that was unlike the artist who’d gone into jail. How could he be the same after the degradation of incarceration? His videos now seemed less like social activism and more like resentment and anger. He became belligerent; there were fights and taunts. Less than a year later he was dead, killed in a drive-­by shooting in Las Vegas. He had just turned twenty-­ five years old. Six months later, when it was announced that the Notorious B.I.G. had been killed—­shot in Los Angeles after a party—­the response in the prison population was nearly identical.

In fact, I hadn’t cried since the night I had attempted suicide at the age of sixteen. Ever since then, I thought I’d lost the ability to cry. Years into my prison sentence, I found myself in the visiting room of a prison in Newberry, Michigan. I was talking with a friend about my feelings as my parole board hearing loomed. It was a highly charged time for me; as the hearing came closer, the injustices I faced on a daily basis seemed focused like the sun through glass, setting fire to the grass all around me. I had been transferred from a prison where I’d ION T U facility, they had placed refused to work two jobs; at theIBnew R T S without cause, leading to my me in solitary for seven DIdays R FO security beingTincreased for no reason.

I didn’t know; NO all I knew was that I knew nothing about the place where those tears came from. I had been taught long and hard to avoid tears—­especially in prison, where strength and the appearance of strength count for so much. But that day, I loved you, Jay, so much that I loved you enough to cry. Those tears were the perfect soil to plant the seeds of freedom. If I was going to make it on the outside, I needed to feel human before I got out of that place. And nothing made me feel more human than the thought of being your dad once my sentence was finally over. Eventually, the visit was over, and I went back to my cell. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 126 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 127 But a set of tectonic plates had shifted in me, somewhere out of sight. I realized that even there, back in that tiny box of pain, I was now freer. It’s hard to express just how much of a change that was. For decades I had battened down my humanity, bound it like an enslaved person’s wrists. As I dug into those new feelings, Jay, my tears of sorrow for you turned into tears of joy for the possibility of a fully lived future. I knew that I could now feel and emote without giving a damn what anyone else thought. The fact of my tears was a sign that I was growing new skin, a skin that would surround a human being.

Backed by the Ford Fund, this is a grassroots organization for Black men, specifically centered around storytelling. No one tells a story better than Big Sean. And you know what else? No one cries better than he does, either! There’s a wonderful video of him performing at the Palace of Auburn Hills. After about two minutes of singing “Memories,” he sits on the edge of the stage and just weeps. His tears come from many places—­a friend struggling with addiction; his struggles with Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 127 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f128 shaka senghor suicidal ideation; the miscarriage of his child. His albums are highly emotional records, and I honor him for that. (He’s cried with me on panels, too.) Just listen to the reaction of the crowd when he breaks down on that video. There are no jeers; there are no boos; there’s a kind of quiet as the crowd try to work out why he’s no longer singing, and then when they realize he’s crying, they cheer his show of emotion. He is loved even more for being a man who can show his vulnerabilities. We must honor a man like Big Sean, just as we must honor all boys and men who have the courage to cry.

I figured he was just concentrating on the ride, or maybe it was one of those moments when a new acquaintanceship dries up like the seed that falls on rocky land in the Bible: “A farmer went out to sow his seed. . . .

But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.” Some relationships aren’t meant to grow. Still, when we arrived at my destination, we exchanged numbers, and something about that young man stayed with me as I went about my day. That same evening, my phone buzzed—­it was a text from K Jr. telling me that his father was on death row in San Quentin. That text broke my heart.

It was a gentle, beautiful day in San Francisco. I’d left early, watching as a breeze ran across the bay, lifting rows of whitecaps into the morning sun. As I turned onto I-­580 to join the traffic speeding over the Richmond Bridge, I watched all the cars and wondered how many of the people in them knew that below them on the headland, the oldest prison in California held more than three and a half thousand men. San Quentin’s death row is Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 130 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 131 the largest in the United States. More than seven hundred of the men in that prison—­737 by early 2019, according to the Los Angeles Times—­are housed in the euphemistically named “Condemned Unit.” There are just fifty-­six countries on the planet that carry out the death penalty; many others have death penalty statutes but no longer execute their citizens. As I passed through the creaky wrought-­iron security gates of the facility, I marveled at that fact: that we in this country are barbarians; that to us, housing people in cages until we execute them is considered a perfectly acceptable form of justice.

San Quentin is the oldest prison in California that wasn’t a ship, a sprawling complex of old buildings, perched precariously on land that oversees a magical view of the bay. I imagine real estate developers would die for a piece of that land. The water looks serene from a distance at least, and on a clear day like this, you can look across the bay and see the monied skyline of San Francisco, one of the most expensive places to live in America. But here the prison stands cold and indifferent—­a blaze of hell on the beautiful edge of theN roiling water.

If you look at the Los Angeles Times website and its list of the 737 men who were on death row at the start of 2019, you’ll see a sea of faces of color. Sure, there are white faces, but mostly it’s Black and Latino men staring back at you. By early 2020, the numbers were 259 Black, 189 Latino, and 239 white. If you add in other races (Native American and Asian), 77 percent of men on death row in San Quentin are people of color. One of those faces belongs to Kevin Cooper. Cooper escaped from prison in 1983 and holed up in a house in Chino Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 132 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 133 Hills. As he hid, a quadruple homicide took place in a nearby house, for which Cooper was convicted and sent to death row. He has consistently denied involvement, and there is plenty of evidence of police and prosecutorial malfeasance in the case. Cooper is currently fighting to have his innocence proven through DNA testing. Like the hundreds of other men slated for execution inside the egg yolk yellow building, Cooper is embroiled in the fight of his life. It’s a brutal and unforgiving process; decades pass while men’s lives are stalled, the blue skies outside their cells darkened by hopelessness. Yet despite the gruesome nature of Nthis environment, IO Tconvicted U where hundreds of men have been of killing and B I R T hundreds more wait to DIbeS killed, San Quentin is staking a R FforOreform.

The idea is to give them valuable tools that they will hopefully be able to use in the job market when they are released. It’s the kind of effort that’s crucial, given the surge in incarcerations. (Fully 25 percent of the world’s incarcerated people are locked up in the United States, and the number has swelled by 700 percent since the time of George Jackson.) But plenty of people, both here and elsewhere, are not giving up. This center of digital hope was born out of a partnership Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 133 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f134 shaka senghor between an innovative nonprofit called the Last Mile, the California Prison Industry, and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. This kind of cooperation was virtually unheard of decades ago, when people were just beginning to go online. Today there are more partnerships like this, which link the states, nonprofits, and corporate America. I had arrived the night before and joined my friends and colleagues the next morning for pastries and coffee at a shop a mile or so from the prison.

I floated into and out of thoughts of the past until I was interrupted by the sound of a short, walnut brown, elderly Black man calling to me. He asked if I’d written the book that was circulating around the cell blocks, and when I told him I had, I watched his smile broaden. His smile felt right in my spirit—­it was as a sacred gift and reminded me why I had come there, come back to prison. I shook his hand, and we embraced. As we did, I felt his thin, worn bones. We headed to the chapel for a meeting, and within seconds Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 134 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 135 of stepping inside, I found myself hugging and greeting dozens of men of all races, all dressed in blue state-­issued uniforms that showed the common inhumanity of incarceration. This blue is the great leveler, each uniform saying “I am here,” a place where no one ever wants to be. I recognized some of the men from previous visits; some I was meeting for the first time. Each told me in his own way that he was proud of me, that my new life outside gave him hope. Their words urged my soul like the winds urged the water out there in the bay, a churn of conflicted feelings. I loved their hugs, their handshakes.

Eventually the crowd settled into their seats, and the program got under way. The dynamic duo of Beverly Parenti and Chris Redlitz, the founders of the Last Mile, were charming hosts and great emcees. MC Hammer, a longtime supporter and champion of the men, was in attendance, offering words of encouragement and empowerment. Graduates of the program—­those who were now free and gainfully employed—­shared their stories of success. Later, my friend Scott Budnick, the founder of the Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 135 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f136 shaka senghor Anti-­Recidivism Coalition (ARC), invited me and a group of other visitors to join him in a guided tour of the prison. Crossing the yard, we greeted many of the hundreds of men playing basketball, exercising, or playing chess. At one point, a young Black guy called to me, “Yo, what size are those shoes?” I told him and asked him if he was sizing me up; it was nice to be able to get a laugh out of him in all that darkness. Then my heart sank; Scott invited me to join him in a visit to death row. A sour feeling gurgled up in my stomach. It didn’t feel right to be going there, that bleak place where life can end at any moment, the block where men, brothers, ION T uncles, friends, and fathers all wait IBUto be put to death.

Was TRI he just another sick S I D all too well from my time racist fuck, the like of whom IRknew O F T in prison? NO But these turned out to be snap judgments, informed by trauma. I was ignorant about that officer. In fact, I didn’t know him from a can of paint; I had judged him based on my own experience of being in prison, and even though that smile meant he fit the description, it was not a correct assessment. When I spoke, he looked me in the eye and asked how he could help me. The truth was, he was a courteous man, thoughtful and professional amid all that death. That place . . . ​Tiers went all the way up, five stories. Iron bars; dark; dreary. To the right of the officer there was an Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 136 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 137 opening that led outside to the yard, where at least a hundred men were held in cages. Each cage held about twenty men. They looked like dog kennels, all in a row, men locked up like nothing more than animals in a city pound, corralled with ropes and sticks by an unfeeling world, left here in cages until their appeals finally ran out, their numbers were called, a last meal was proffered, they made the walk to death, from the cage to the chair. They were waiting to be euthanized, those poor men in cages—­I wanted to scream the word “cages”—­ with no home save this barbaric place; they were no longer seen as human by the society that had failed them.

Why do people think dehumanizing and degrading people is the solution?” But it was not the moment to scream; it was the moment to connect, or at least try to. So I went to where the men on death row were held in cages. I tried saying hello to some of them, to make some kind of connection with them. But all I could actually mumble was “Hey.” What do you say to men Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 137 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f138 shaka senghor who are waiting to be put to death by the state? I felt inadequate. This was horror. Eventually, a middle-­aged Black man called out to me, “Hey, are you Shaka, the guy who wrote that book?” His eyes lit up when I greeted him. “A brother named K let me read your book, he said you knew his son. Hey, man, I write too. This is my book.” It all came in a rush of words as he shoved a piece of paper through the gate into my hand with his book cover on it.

I wanted to tell them then that I had been in cell blocks for nearly two decades, that I knew it was possible, that I knew what it meant to be in a cage, knew what it meant to wait, wait, wait—­but I refrained. Fortunately, the lieutenant sent an officer up to K’s cell to ask if he wanted to come down and meet me. I stood at the officer’s desk for what felt like an eternity, waiting for an answer. Finally, the officer returned and said that K had agreed to come down. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 138 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 139 Time seemed to stop. Seconds stretched to minutes stretched to what felt like hours. But then K appeared with his hands cuffed behind his back. When he saw me, his eyes lit up and a smile slowly creased his face. He looked young and vibrant, somehow, even though he was caged like all the other men. He was placed in a cell inside a small room; I found myself standing on the outskirts, looking at him through the bars. “It’s good to see you,” we said simultaneously. The coincidence of our shared words caused us to smile and shook free all my words and feelings about his son, K Jr. ION T K beamed with pride as I told him about our various text IBU R T messages and how thoughtful I had found his son to be.

Tears welled up in my eyes, because despite his circumstances, K had found a way to reach his son’s heart. He had found a way to bestow lessons on his son that had urged him onto a path to graduating from college, not onto a path that led to prison or death row. K had not given up on or given in to his circumstances. He had fostered dignity in his son, had found a way to be a father, a mentor, and above all a man. Somehow, he’d done those things from a cell on tier four in the death row cell block inside San Quentin.

Like transformation, fatherhood can happen anywhere when we create the space for it to blossom. Jay, I failed in my attempts to foster these things while I was in prison.

But if those two men can become as one; if Mandela could survive to lead his country; if Malcolm X could change the world; if our brothers and sisters have triumphed over and through the walls all around us, then we, too, can figure this out.

Every day Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 141 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f142 shaka senghor was a battle, and often I felt I was losing that fight. Some mornings, just getting out of bed took effort, like trying to pull a great weight up a hill. I regularly stood at the bottom of that hill and looked up, unable to move. It was during that time that I decided to leave Detroit and move to California. I thought a change of scenery would restore optimism to my heart and give me a shot of hope—­and what a change, from freezing winters to year-­round 70 degrees and sunny skies. I had traded on optimism so far, and it had helped here ION T and there. I figured that in a looser IBU place, one of palm trees R T S and sea breezes and the of a city built on HollyDIvibrancy R O could take root inside me and get me Fhope wood’s glamour, OT N to a better place. It didn’t take me long to realize that the environment N is far hadn’t been the problem; what happens inside IaOperson T U IB more important than what’s going on R T outside. S I D There were truly dark times. OR F T Shortly after my O N book was published, I went on tour to publicize it, and for several weeks I told and retold the story of my worst moments to readers, to journalists, to audiences, to people I met along the way. That was the nature of the endeavor, of course; like many authors, my job was to drum up interest in my story, and one of the most effective ways is to show up, talk, listen to questions, answer them, open up, always open up, tell stories, tell stories, tell stories. The words I repeated, the terrible things to which I confessed over and over—­sometimes they could feel like just words. But mostly, I was repeatedly dragged back into my worst experiences, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 142 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 143 reopening and revisiting profound traumas with no idea how to process them away from the glare of faces turned my way. It was no one’s fault, not even my own, but to continually recount the worst parts of my life, to every day take a knife to my skin without numbing myself beforehand . . . ​the blood flowed, and I could not stop it. All that pain just pooled inside me, behind my eyes, deep in an untouchable part of me. Once the microphones went quiet, once the lights were turned off, once the hotel room door latched and another night on the road found me in a small room in a distant city, my luggage, sitting there next to my bed N every time I opened IO T my eyes, was the past and everything IBU that had happened and R T ISfeelings I had for that younger self what I’d paid for it andD the R O for me here, now, away from family and FI had and the feelings OT N friends, another night of retelling it all looming ahead in my mind, keeping me from sleep.

The S I Dout there, on the road, tellsea of incarcerated faces keptRme O F T ing their stories through NO my own, telling my story so that they might one day feel the release of forgiveness and freedom. That was what I told myself; but the reality is that there is no greater good than taking care of and nurturing your own self, giving succor to your own heart, giving your own mind a place to rest. I had no desire to be an emotional martyr, but I felt, too, that it was my job to tell the truth about the pain and devastation my actions had caused to my family and to the family of the man I’d killed. So what if the hotel rooms were empty and cold? So what if the luggage of my past loomed like dark shapes behind blackout shades? So Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 143 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f144 shaka senghor what if the nights of torment were like the distant sound of the freeways beside which motels unrestfully lie? My purpose overrode these high ideals: I had to help other young men avoid the same pitfalls that had claimed my youth. If I lay awake in torment, hadn’t something in my past prepared me for that? More damagingly, I’ve wondered since then if my guilt over the past made me think I had it coming, that desperation of the road. In short, I asked myself, who was I to complain? For five years straight I had ripped openNthe wounds of my TIO U past for the world to see. B RI ISTin the midst of that effort, I lost Was it any wonder D that OR my sense of self-­ T Flove?

Matthew 13: “For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.” I broke hearts easily with no thought of the other person’s life beyond my conquest. Love felt like a bullshit emotion; I couldn’t capture it, contain it, or maintain it. Most of the time, I couldn’t even feel it. Was that what I had survived prison for?

But I knew that however many times I told my story in public, there would always be a depth to it that no other person could understand. Shit, I wouldn’t want another person to understand it; I wouldn’t wish my experiences upon anyone.

In my dating life, I felt as though women were attracted to the idea of me rather than the real me. But in each new relationship, I faced from the very first second not just the threat of that barrier—­not just of what cannot be empathized with or understood—­ but another, more insidious barrier: the things I spoke of, the violence and death and depravity of prison; those were things that I could never love about myself, either. It was not as simple as being on a date and telling a potential new partner about a job that was horrible or the death of a family member or whatever setbacks normal people chat about.

Each day was an effort to learn to walk again. * Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 146 * * 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 147 I could learn to walk again—­I had to do so. But would the world let me? As a child I lived the life of an outlaw. I was doing bad shit, and though I tried not to get caught, at least there would be a natural logic to it if I did. I still had a sense of right and wrong, of action followed by consequence. That meant that I could still retain a certain grim optimism: there was still an expectation that if I toed the line, the right things would happen. That feeling never left me (and probably made prison even harder than it might otherwise have been; I wasn’t so far gone that I couldn’t still see, taste, smell, sense injustice). ION T After prison, the sense remained: IBU I’d paid for my mistakes, R T and if I did the right things—­ DIS toed the line, kept out of trouR FO license and car registration up to date, ble, kept my driver’s OT N got a job, and made money—­the world would leave me alone and good things would accrue.

Just like that, a young white police officer shows up and taps on the window. “Hey, what are you doing?” he asks. “I’m just smoking a cigar in my car,” I say, “because it’s a bit nippy out there.” Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 147 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f148 shaka senghor “Do you have your license?” Now, I’m not even moving at this point—­I’m not driving anywhere. There’s no probable cause here. But I can see something in the officer’s eyes—­how did he get this car, this nice car, in this neighborhood?—­all the usual things. Here’s the deal, though: I am fucking loving this because I have a damned license, and I have insurance and current registration and I like my car, and it’s all good. “And no, Officer,” I say as I hand him my license, “I don’t have anything illegal on me.” After a bit he comes back to the car, he gives back my ID, my registration, and says, “Everything came back good.” ION T And as he’s saying this, I glance IBU into the rearview mirror R T IS and there are five police sitting there.

What about my safety? You’re the one with the gun.” Okay, Shaka, maintain control—­don’t let this slip into some shit that’s unnecessary. But I am a man, you know?

Why am I in a parking lot with five or six police surrounding me and I haven’t done shit? It’s embarrassing. This new friend doesn’t really know me, and now some flatfoot has my arm behind my back. Just as I’m calming myself, a sergeant steps up and says, “So. Tell me about the murder in 1991.” I have told the world about the murder.

I spent many years in prison, but Sergeant, I am no longer incarcerated or even on parole, truths you ignore when you refer to my conviction in 1991 as though I am a murderer rather than someone who, as a child, committed murder. I understand that as a quasi–­military force you need a bad guy, and what you found on your cruiser’s little computer was my name and the date 1991 and a conviction. I realize that your attitude changed when you realized I teach at the fucking Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 149 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f150 shaka senghor University of Michigan and am a fellow at the MIT Media Lab, and I write books—­and yes, feel free to buy one, there are some in the trunk of this Taurus.

I called one of my sisters and asked if she’d hang out. I’d missed her birthday by a week and wanted to make it up to her. Remembering that she loved lamb chops, I suggested a place I knew made the best damn chops in Detroit, a strip club. Yes, I went for lunch with my sister to a strip club during its day shift. A few more calls were made, and all my damn sisters showed up, and the party was on. We were doing shots, drinking champagne, the works—­I was tipping and chatting, tipping and chatting, in my element, an N image of freedom, I IO T guess, though inside I was hurting IBU hard from the events of R T the day. This, too, is sometimes how our community deals—­ DIS R FOseen as an addictive force, so when pain alcohol isn’t really OT N arrives, we bury it in drinking and partying, because what else are we going to do?

Suddenly it was three in the morning, Jerry had disappeared, and I was left with that unhealthy mixture of alcohol and delusion: Sure, I’m a better driver when drunk. I jumped into my truck and headed for home. Let me pause here and take you up above the scene; let’s Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 152 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 153 watch it like we’re a news helicopter.

There are no cops around, and we’re hearing that he’s done this enough nights that he’s sure he’ll make it home.

He might kill himself; he might kill someone else; he might just survive long enough to be pulled over, arrested, taken back to prison, see? Isn’t that what those guards said? See you soon, son! You’ll be back! Your type is always back. By now, viewers, it’s pretty clear that he understands the mistake he’s made—­he knows it’s the exit ramp, but what can he do?

And now the weather forecast, brought to you by Heineken—­ drink responsibly . . . It wasn’t the first time I’d danced with disaster.

But when I got home that rainy night after my wrong-­way drive, I was shaking, knowing that all the new and wonderful things would have gone away had red and blue lights flashed in my rearview. It brought to mind the degradation of being strip-­searched, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 154 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 155 the mug shot, the clanking doors . . . ​having to leave a child behind once again. Imagine the shame of that. Back when I’d been nineteen, I’d faced those degradations as a child—­all of them new. But I was a child no longer that night in Detroit. I was a man, and not just any man but a leader in my community, a voice in the fight against criminal injustice. I pictured the flick of a police light; me on the side of a rainy freeway, soaked; two officers running my details, not knowing what they’d find until they found it. And this, this disaster, this downfall, would serveNonly to underline IO T U everything the system thinks about someone like me: that we B I R T S wrongs.

By the grace of God or the serendipity of the universe, I did not have to face those things. But I knew then that things must change. I could not put myself in that position ever again. There was too much to lose. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 155 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f156 shaka senghor * * * This is how it all started. I believe addiction is a by-­product of shame and suppressed emotions and unhealed hurts. And I had the unfortunate chance to learn about all those things. At fourteen years old, a life of pain was already my lot. I had been introduced to Detroit’s drug culture by an older hustler; he had cash and power, two intoxicating things to a kid who had neither. It was the start of a terrible nourishment. I thought the guy would give me shelter from my dysfunctional, violent childhood, but as INtold an interviewer IO UT just doesn’t work like years later, “Unfortunately theIB world R IST children, I got seduced into that. And like many vulnerable D R FOolder, the drug tradeTby more seasoned street hustlers, and O N that’s how it happens for a lot of kids.” It had been bad enough when heroin and cocaine had puncN tuated my city, but by late 1983, early 1984, the TIO first crack U B houses were appearing. In a documentary TRI series called AmeriS I DBJ Chambers described what can Dope, a Detroit hustler named OR F T happened when he was NO part of creating the first wave of the crack epidemic. Originally, he had been selling weed, but in early 1984 he’d loaned a friend some money to sell a new, shiny drug called crack cocaine at a house on the corner of Newport and Jefferson, just about a mile from my childhood home. He’d given his friend twenty-­four hours to make it work; by the time Chambers showed up at the house the next day, the friend had made $30,000, and a whole new hell had arrived. Those were death packets, sold for cheap thrills to those who could least afford to pay, and the drug wasn’t just for adults. I saw teenagers lured by the white toxic devil smoke, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 156 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 157 scorching their growing lungs, the euphoric intoxication promised them the good life in a city that had once been thriving. According to a Black former undercover DEA agent, John Sutton, there “was something missing [in Detroit] . . . ​there was a tremendous erosion of the political system, an erosion of the police department, an erosion of the religious system in this city.” Just as Sutton didn’t say that with any sense of superiority, my friends and I felt the last part not as a theory but as part of our daily lives. I felt it when I faced death in a urine-­soaked hallway, staring at messengers with guns. I felt it when I took refuge in garages and dank basements filled ION T with shit, knowing my life didn’t matter. I slept on bricks for IBU R T pillows, pillows that made DISmy head hard and my heart harder. R FO I became aTdealer. O N I’d gotten caught up in what is known as “the drug culture”—­but culture is the wrong word, or at least one meanN ing of it is. “Drug culture” suggests a collectiveIO T effort to creU B are norms that ate something that lasts, a place whereRthere T I S I DI knew was more about soliare followed. But the drug culture OR F T and it was more about destructude, not shared experience; NO tion, not a shared effort of creation. So I suppose culture is the right word in one sense—­culture, as in an artificial medium in which things grow—­in this case, pain and suffering. By 1986, crack cocaine had overtaken Detroit. That was my childhood; it was the culture that shaped me. You could argue that crack hit Detroit worse than any other major American city, and I was primed to be a part of it. Yet my first addiction was not to drugs but to the elusive hope of safety. We saw much older men, and sometimes women, getting rich and powerful on our dangerous streets, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 157 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f158 shaka senghor so of course we were drawn to the lifestyle. They, in turn, recognized a cheap labor force, one that wouldn’t draw as much scrutiny by the police or punishment by the courts. These days, even in 2020, we hear horrifying stories of child soldiers—­in Cameroon, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen—­and the stories are heartbreaking. But in the drug culture in which I grew up, we were child soldiers, too. We didn’t carry Kalashnikovs and we didn’t march in formation and in uniform, but we were similarly brutalized and forced into violence and degradation by a world of adults who saw no difference between a child and a N grown-­up, whether IO T U police. those adults were the dealers orIBthe R T IS the drugs I was slinging. Crack Eventually, I startedDusing R FOobject, the Mercedes-­Benz of social party was the shinyT new O N drugs. No one knew it was going to be so devastating. All we wanted was escape, escape from the shame we felt, and crack N was the ultimate escape. ($30,000 worth of sales TIOin one day? U B Hell, yeah, I’m not even a bit surprised.) TRII knew I was a smart S I Dbut there I was, deep in the kid—­I wanted to be a doctor—­ OR F T drug culture. I was doing NO shameful things, and the quick high of crack was too much to resist. I inhaled deeply of the drug and died momentarily as a thick plume of white smog pulled me into the darkness, the only place I felt safe. But there was another price to pay. When they discovered that I’d been smoking the crack I was supposed to be selling, three grown men took me into a bathroom and pummeled me to mush. Heavy kicks bounced off my skull. There was no mercy in that world; everything was transactional. I was only as good as my last sale, and if I was smoking what I was supposed to be selling, I was a broken part of the machinery that Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 158 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 159 needed to be bent back into shape. Eventually they gave up beating me, and as I lay on that bathroom floor, the coldness of the floor tiles was a great comfort; I remember resting my bloodied face there, listening to the footsteps recede. The blood pooled; my face grew cold; I was alone in pain and shame with no one to comfort me or kiss away the fear. In that terrifying moment, I cried razor blades, carving rivers of emptiness and sorrow in my young skin. From that day on, pain became my traveling companion. I grew colder than the winds that blew across Lake Michigan, colder than the winds that froze Belle Isle,Nwhere we frolicked IO on the beach in warm weather.IBUT TR That was my childhood.

TIO U B Here, too, there’s a cold reality: ourRaddicted brothers and T I S I D sisters are treated horribly. For women, their bodies become OR F T bargaining tools; their NO families lose trust in them; they’re often brutalized on the streets. Men face physical assaults constantly. Their dignity disappears, and when they’re arrested, they’re often overcharged. We avoid any sense of empathy, because empathy is a danger we cannot afford. We are trying to keep our children away from it, so we can’t allow ourselves to see the humanity of the addicted person; it’s a threat too real to accommodate in our neighborhoods and homes. What this banishment does, of course, is pile shame upon shame upon shame for the addicted person. We may speak words that sound like empathy—­that addiction is an illness, not a Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 159 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f160 shaka senghor moral failing, for example—­but we don’t really mean them. We want the addicted person kept away in a kind of medieval hospital where the doors are locked and no one can get out. The addicted are given drug substitutes until those substitutes stop working; or else they’re sent out into the streets when the money to treat them runs out, if there was any money in the first place; and they are too often nowhere near ready to return to the place where their shame forced them into addiction in the first place. I knew that shame. When I left prison, I had spent the best part of two decades having every decision made for me.

I carried with me a huge backpack filled with survivor’s guilt—­already, two of my nephews had been shot, and I still had a lot of friends in prison. These are the pressures our community faces. We feel guilty over our successes, knowing that our friends lie dead or in prison, the weight of our ancestors like burdens around our necks. Even when we’re technically free, there are forces at work that keep us on a train line of pain: violence, Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 160 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 161 imprisonment, poverty, racism. Even when we make something positive of it all, we’re just a second away from being pulled over and having our records brought up on the little evil computer in a cop car. My forebears had gone through Hell and survived, all for me to end up in prison at nineteen for the murder of someone. How would I ever escape those burdens? This, then, was the lethal mixture of pressure and shame I faced in the years after I left prison—­or almost lethal, as you’ll see.

If you’re hurting, this is the least significant part of your being. The culture will care about you insofar as it will use your past to deny you something; but it won’t care if you admit that you’re suffering. So here’s the only way out: your hurt and your pain and your healing and your happiness are your own responsibility. You have to choose how you want to navigate these things. Are these parts of your soul going to be eternally damaging and damning, or might they provide a moment of light through which you can grow? Because there is a deep power Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 161 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f162 shaka senghor in recognizing your own fragility. When we have the courage to unearth the things that make us feel afraid, uncertain, or inadequate, it gives us the opportunity to strengthen those areas that would otherwise wreak havoc in our lives. The cracks in a structure widen until eventually they cause the building to collapse. It’s better to find and fix the cracks than to have to rebuild from the ground up. Every day, ask yourself this: What’s the origin story of my life?

Whatever it is that coats the very walls and floors and bars, I could be blindfolded, my hearing gone, but if you walked me into a prison, I would always know where I was from that stench. And that odor was never more vivid than on the day I went to Wayne County Jail to see you. Nearly twenty years after my own arrest, I found myself walking back into that place. I didn’t want to be there—­God, I didn’t—­but I had to be. Beyond the smell, the sounds jarred me deep into my past: Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 165 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f166 shaka senghor keys jangling on the belts of the officers, doors slamming shut, distant shouts echoing down cell blocks.

Without a flicker of courtesy he took my ID, and I realized then that I’d have to report the visit to my parole officer—­worse, I knew for certain that this guard was going to run my name through the system to see if I had any warrants, and it would surely bring up the fact that I had been recently released from prison.

You had been walking home from a night out, minding your own business, and you were picked up for nothing. Before you knew it, you were in handcuffs, thrown into the back of a squad car. In my encounters with police as a teenager, it was clear that something in my life was terribly wrong, but no one ever asked me. I remember describing an incident to Oprah in an interview: how I’d gone home in fourth grade with a great report card, and my mother’s reaction had been to throw a pan at me—­it had missed and broken tiles on the wall behind Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 166 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 167 me. Later, when Oprah asked when I’d left home, I said at fourteen, but she smartly pointed out that it had really happened that day when my efforts in school had been met with violence. It took her empathy and insight to make that connection; but out on the streets, young men like me and you were never afforded such an effort.

In Kalief ’s case, it was probably clear from the outset to the officers and the subsequent prosecutors that it was a lousy case, but still Kalief was arrested, his bail was set at $3,000, and his family could in no way afford the $900 that the bondsman would charge. So off he went to Rikers Island, at which point, a disaster was born. If only we could train police officers to be more like nurses and doctors and less like soldiers . . . ​Clearly, they’re still going to come up against people who want to hurt them—­ it’s important to make sure that the public is safe—­but they Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 167 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f168 shaka senghor don’t have to do so in a militarized way. If you’re in the military, you start with the intention to kill, not to serve. What’s more, Black communities are often policed by white suburban men whose interpretation of that community comes from the news and the media. And the depiction in the media does not allow for a good Black father or a Black man who is not a criminal. Seldom do we see a boring, bland Black man living a boring, bland life—­going to work, going to the store, cleaning out his gutters on the weekend.

That rock band, formed in 1970, was made up of police officers who would visit schools to play rock, soul, R&B, all with a message to get us to stay away from drugs. The group lasted nearly fifty years, and when I was a child, that’s what the police were to us: they interacted with us, brought horses and helicopters to our schools so we could marvel at them—­until later, when the helicopters hovered over us every night, as though we were in a war zone. When the crack cocaine era hit, everything changed. Those Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 168 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 169 were the days when the police would just pull over in the hood and slam you up against the car. Even when cops gave us a break, it often came without due process. I was in my teens, selling drugs in a crack house, when the place was raided. By that point I was instinctively supersavvy—­I dumped the drugs down the heat register, where they just burned up. The cops were whooping everyone’s ass, and I remember this one officer saw me and shouted, “What the fuck are you doing in here?” I was fourteen, and he punched me in my balls, saying “Don’t let me catch you here again.” The officer took the money I had and drove me home to my father, which wasn’t ION T exactly justice, either.

Kalief was not a gang OR F T of the most dangerous NO places in America. He was placed in a Bloods house and had to look out for himself. Kalief ’s brother describes Rikers as “Gladiator School” (sadly, there are such gladiator schools all across the country where juveniles and adults are left to fight). Kalief suffered beatings, both at the hands of the boys and the hands of corrections officers. The damage was done. In his time at Rikers, Kalief tried to commit suicide, as he himself put it, “five or six times.” Meanwhile, his case was delayed and delayed, most likely because he kept refusing to take a plea.

It was devastating to learn of your arrest and to know you had been picked up for being the first Black boy the police encountered. (They had been searching for armed robbery suspects in the neighborhood.) You were Kalief, and he was you; you were the Exonerated Five from Central Park, and they were you, and on and on and on, degradation piled upon degradation, injustice just the way of it. There I was, though, that day in Wayne County Jail, wondering how you would be able to overcome this injustice. I thought, too, about what it would be likeNto go to my parole IO UTyou.

I had made it out of prison without your coming in. As the guard handed me back my ID, I thought about my own father walking into that building to see me. What if this was the same officer who had processed my father all those years ago? How many fathers and sons had he witnessed living like this? How did he cope with seeing broken families at their lowest day after day after day? The coldness he displayed—­was it his own fear writ Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 170 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 171 large in ice? Was it disappointment? Was it resignation? Or, after all those years, had he just shut off his feelings as a way to save himself ? Before I could process all of that, I was taken to see you. On my way down the corridor, I thought about all the ways I’d tried to ensure that you didn’t follow in my footsteps and all the ways I’d failed in that endeavor. Well, it was too late now. All I could do was prepare you to fight for your freedom and to prepare you mentally for prison, if things went as badly for you as they so often did for young Black men.

They were going to be so far out of your life, they could never imagine a place so cold, so dank, so terrifying. “It’s going to be all right” hadn’t been what I’d needed to hear, and it sure as shit wasn’t what you’d need.

What words could I find other than “It’s going to be all right”? I’m a writer, but sometimes words feel so thin, like a kind of weak broth. But we weren’t quite repeating the cycle, because unlike me, you were innocent. The justice system tried to get you to plead guilty to a robbery you didn’t commit.

You survived all of that. But I wonder what scars it has given you, deep scars that I may never see. It’s hard to maintain optimism. It’s hard not to feel as though you’re always up under this fucking weight of the past. How can I best help my son get through life, feeling empowered, feeling brave and confident, without his being Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 172 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 173 damaged by all my shit? Staying in a perpetual state of anger certainly doesn’t lead to solutions, that much I know. Instead, now I try always to ask myself, what is the solution? I think it’s sharing authentic stories and telling authentic stories, no matter how devastating. So it is with a heavy heart I must finish Kalief ’s story, at least as it pertains to his time on Earth. On June 6, 2015, two years after his release from Rikers, Kalief died by suicide.

We tell boys that they should have as much sex as they want, that they’re soft or weak if they’re not sexually active, and that sex with older women is something to aspire to—­it validates their manhood. Perhaps the most famous case is that of Vili Fualaau and Mary Kay Letourneau. In the summer of Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 175 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f176 shaka senghor 1996, thirteen-­year-old Vili had sex with—­no, was sexually assaulted by—­his teacher, Mary Kay Letourneau.

A child was born, and though Letourneau was convicted of two counts of second-­degree child rape and sentenced to eighty-­nine months in prison, she continued to see Vili after she got out on parole after three months and was reincarcerated for six years. Another daughter was born from the sex they’d had when she was out of prison. Once Letourneau was released for good, she and Vili married. Vili had been open about the fact thatN he “went through a IO T really dark time” while Letourneau IBU was in prison, but in the R T press, the story morphed DISinto something resembling a great R FasOif the world now accepted the love affair romance. It was OT N version of the story, not the abuse aspect. The two were married for fourteen years, separating in 2019. (Letourneau died N of cancer in 2020.)

The problem is widespread in our community, too, and it’s time to become aware of it. Before we go any further, let me say this: it is not normal for a child to be exposed to sex, and it should not be celebrated. Black boys and men are seen as sexual beings; it is a viewpoint foisted on us without our consent, without thought, without any hope of denying it. So many of the terrible acts of violence against Black boys Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 176 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 177 and men come from false allegations of sexual misconduct. What this means for you is that however you view your own sexuality, the mere color of your skin will dictate that you’re seen as a sexual threat, a malevolent force. But what about inside Black culture itself ? Are we without blame? I’m afraid to tell you that we are not. Inside our own culture, young Black boys and men are sexualized; nonbinary, gay, and transgender people live under a constant threat of violence, all the way up to being killed. The power of this trope coming in from the white culture has permeated our own sense of self and left us confused and damaged. ION T Let me tell you about my experience. This is very hard IBU R T for me to share, but I need DISto do so in order to warn you and R O Fhopefully educate you and steer you into a healthier, more OT N complete, more fulfilling life.

I remember TRI reading an article S I Dyoung and feeling confused in a men’s magazine when I was OR F T when the men beingOinterviewed talked about their childN hood sweethearts and their first memories of being in love. What was this love they were talking about? My experience had taught me that sex was not connected to the gentler feelings; it was purely transactional. I thought such talk meant that they were soft or square or both. As I read, I remember thinking that no one must have wanted them when they were younger, and that’s why it had taken them so long to lose their virginity. Even then, they could only have sex once they felt love. Whatever the reason, all I knew was that it was not my Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 177 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f178 shaka senghor experience, nor the experience of so many young Black boys and men around me. Deep down, though, I sensed something extraordinary, something I couldn’t admit to myself: those men had made a conscious decision about when they wanted to become sexually active, a chance I’d never had. They talked about wanting to honor their sexuality, honor the experience of intimacy, honor their own bodies. And even though I sensed the beauty of it, it still felt like reading a foreign language.

I was part of a much older crew; the place was filled with older homies who knew so much more than I did about the dangers of life. That day, a woman came to the door offering to exchange oral sex for drugs. I was in the dining room, listening to the exchange, when my older homeboy called me over. “Lil homie,” he said, “she’s going to suck your dick for a rock.” There was no question about it. He stated it as a Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 178 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 179 matter of fact, as if he were telling me it was sunny outside and the leaves on the trees were green. He had no idea if I’d ever been sexually active, and he didn’t ask if I even wanted such an exchange. Among those men sex was not seen as a sacred thing, an act in which two people exchange love and cherish each other. It was part of a complicated and damaging bartering system, two bodies colliding against their deeper wills and needs. One, a boy; the other, a woman addicted; each preyed upon by those around them, preyed upon by each other, preyed upon by the culture in which they found themselves. N TIO U The actual act was terrifying, degrading, and sickening. IB R T IS She was probably living on the I wasn’t attracted to D her. R O physical degradation that brings down streets, with T allFthe O N upon a human body, but I was too ashamed to say that I didn’t want to do it. Yes, I wanted to be accepted by and fit in with N the older guys in the crew. Yes, there was really TIO no choice; U B they would have verbally brutalized R T meI for saying no. But S I DI had no way of processing the truth of it was, I was a child. OR F the moment, no wayOofT saying I didn’t want to do it. I was N not seen as the kid I was, just as the woman was not seen as a victim. She was probably forty years old, the same age as our mothers, our aunts, perhaps some of our older sisters. Despite the fact that she was addicted, without shelter, and lost to the desperate streets of my hometown, she was also a person of authority because of her age. Yes, she was a customer, and this was commerce; I had a product she needed, and in the minds of the older guys, the transaction would benefit me. But behind it all, she was old enough to be my mother, my Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 179 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f180 shaka senghor teacher, the pastor’s wife. She held sway over me, even though I seemed to control the transaction. Of course, I did not control the transaction; the older men did, and to them, it was nothing out of the ordinary. They weren’t intending to wound the emotions of a young boy, set him up for abuse and pain. It was play to them. They thought they were doing me a solid. Reluctantly I went to the side of the house, and she quickly unzipped my pants and went down on me. Quickly, I felt something I had never felt before—­not pleasure or joy, just a physical sensation that overtook me, almost painful but ION T powerful and secret in a way that engaged my deepest interIBU R T est.

But I also felt dirty, disgusted, and used. I had been raped. And then the floodgates opened. A month or so later, I was seduced by another older woman. She was in her early twenties. Her words coiled off her thick, sensuous lips, and the warmth of her breath slid up my skin as she whispered, “I bet I can seduce you.” She was not homeless; she was attractive. I didn’t know what “seduce” Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 180 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 181 meant, but when she pulled my hand toward her soft breasts, I knew that it was going to feel incredible. That was where I felt confused. Something that felt wrong in my heart still felt right in my body; it was taboo, yes, but like many taboos, men in our community simply didn’t talk about it. The first time with her was at least less degrading than with the woman who was addicted. From that experience, my body became addicted to the warm pleasure she provided. It didn’t matter that we were on a soiled mattress in the back room of a crack house or that she was an adult and I was a ION T child. All I knew was that I feltIas though I had died and gone BU R T to Heaven. DIS R FO After our first sexual encounter, I couldn’t stop thinking OT N about her. Just one look at her sent a surge of excitement through my teenage body. I craved her even in the moments N I knew I couldn’t have her. My heart opened likeIO T a wildflower; U B eventually I convinced her to have sex with TRI me a second time, S I D in her blood. I was terbut that time I found myself R covered O F T rified, as though I’d O Ninjured myself or her, and I had no idea what had happened until I got back to the bedroom and she said, “You made my period come down early, boy.” Those were my first encounters—­devoid of intimacy, filled with things I could not understand, overwhelming, exciting, and yet degrading. They left me attracted to older women and addicted to meaningless and empty sex. For so many formative years, that was the only kind of sex I ever experienced. In the following years I moved home to live with my father and stepmother. Part of me wanted to return to the innocence of childhood, but it was too late. I had been lured into the Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 181 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f182 shaka senghor world of sex, and there was no turning back. I sought out sexually active girls and older women in the neighborhood, and sometimes they sought me out. It is shocking to remember how many adult women I slept with when I was a young teenager. I sought out those older women, charmed them, and then lured them into taking advantage of my virility and youth. They knew the game, too; they allowed me to take control and dominate them as if I were a man capable of handling the complexities of such encounters. Then, just when I thought I had the game mastered, it turned, and women began to pursue me. They ION T wanted what I could provide them—­ IBU money or drugs—­they R T never wanted me for me.

NO But let’s be clear once and for all: I was a child. Those were rapes. Did I think of it as sexual assault then? No—­I had no idea what was happening to me because the word “seduction” didn’t sound violent or life threatening. It sounded alluring to my teenage ears. Something stirred in me that I had never felt before. Sadly, those early sexual experiences, which occurred during the height of the crack epidemic, were not unique to me. Unhealthy sexual encounters between young drug dealers Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 182 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 183 and women who would do anything for a hit were common. In my opinion, they were largely responsible for the misogyny that manifested in the music of that era. Let’s not forget that most of the rappers of that time were young boys articulating what was happening in their communities. (People forget sometimes that those artists were just kids.) Prior to crack entering our communities, it was nearly unheard of for women to be called “bitches” and “hoes,” especially by boys. We had long been taught to respect and honor the women in our community. However, once crack took over and women began using their bodies as barterION T ing tools, respect for them diminished. Can you imagine a IBU R T fourteen-­year-­old boy trying DIS to respect a woman whom at one R FO with the same reverence he held for an time he had viewed OT N aunt or mother but who was now aggressively pursuing him for sex in exchange for money, drugs, or prestige? N TIO U B About nine years into my prison sentence, TRI I began to examine S I Da different lens. It was sickmy sexual experiences through OR F T ening to realize just O N how much pedophilia had been normal- ized in the world of my youth. As a teenage boy, the onus of responsibility had been on me, and I admit that I enjoyed many of the experiences. However, when I began to process all of this as an adult, I had a burning need to know why everyone around me thought it was okay for adult women to have sex with teenage boys, so I found someone to ask. When I got out of prison, people from my old neighborhood began to send me friend requests on Facebook. I accepted all of them because I wanted to catch up with people, even the ones who had abandoned me. But eventually I Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 183 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f184 shaka senghor started to delete those so-­called friends because I didn’t want to bring up old negative feelings. While doing so, I came across a woman who used to live in my neighborhood. Her son and I were the same age and knew each other a bit. One summer, the woman had approached me pretty aggressively, and we had started to have sex, usually in her basement. Now, all these years later, the image of those encounters caused my stomach to turn. A sour taste filled my mouth as I remembered that adult woman having sex with the little boy I had been. I could have walked away from thoseNimages, that taste TIOto ask what had hapU in my mouth. Instead, I messaged her B RI ISTfor her to have sex with me. She pened to her to make itDeasy OR told me that she T Fhadn’t had a habit of having sex with young O N she had been drunk, and it had been out of boys; basically, character for her. In further conversations, she denied that N as I’d she had had sex with another boy in the neighborhood, TIO U B been told she had, and further, she claimed TRI that the incident S I D with me was well behind her—­ and totally forgotten about. OR F T Her conscience was “clean NO and clear.” This, then, is the depth of the problem. Even when confronted many years later, a perpetrator of abuse can put it down to alcohol or lessen its importance with claims of being morally good in the present day. (I won’t bore you with the scripture she quoted at me.) She even asked if my attempts to understand what had happened to me and to hold her responsible were in some ways connected to my own shame about the murder I had committed. Her messages to me were a harsh lesson in the way our culture still views Black boys as fair game, as somehow unharmed Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 184 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 185 by abuse. Many of the men I grew up with had similar experiences, but very few called it rape. In our adolescent minds, we just thought we were being birthed into adulthood. But years later, when the novelty of reckless, empty, meaningless sex wore off, I realized how much we had all been violated. My innocence, such as it was, had been stripped from me, leaving in its wake nearly two decades of being incapable of loving or accepting love. Yes, I enjoyed the sex, but it came with a heavy price; my sexual and emotional health was compromised. I became promiscuous, sexually reckless, incapable of trusting women. I lost years that could never be replaced ION T and was denied the pleasures and IBUinnocence of teenage love. R T Yet the culture continues DIS to reward such encounters and R FO suffer from them. It’s the one culture I vilify the boysT who O N would love to see canceled and condemned. When I appeared on The Breakfast Club in 2017 and admitted that I’d been fourN teen years old when an older woman had first raped TIO me, a co-­ U IB just eight when it host, Charlamagne tha God, said he’d R Tbeen S I D had happened to him. What was amazing about that interview OR F T was that when I said O N that I couldn’t relate to girls of my own age because I’d been dealing with grown women, Charlamagne seemed to have an epiphany. He said, “I like older women, too—­but I never looked at the correlation.” I know it is hard to look at women as sexual predators or to imagine them doing harm. In fact, I had so much fun sexually that it took a serious emotional leap for me to realize the extent of the damage those encounters caused. Today I am proud to say that I am a survivor of rape, and I now have a healthy emotional outlook on women. But, Sekou, I don’t ever want you to have to write the first half Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 185 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f186 shaka senghor of the sentence I just wrote.

They were held there in shackles until their captors pushed them through the door of no return, heading to the New World. They were our ancestors. I traveled to Ghana in December 2019. On the way over, I was listening to rap and realized, with a great jolt, that the word “nigger” hadn’t existed on the continent to which I was traveling. It was Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 187 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f188 shaka senghor a word invented in the Americas, by Americans, to further denigrate and debase people who hadn’t wanted to come in the first place. I would never look at that word the same way again. Little did I know that it would be one of the many moments of clarity that trip would afford me. The year 2019 was the four hundredth anniversary since the last slave ships had left and was slated to be a year of remembrance—­the Year of Return.

Standing there in those dungeons I didn’t feel only the sense of dread, the degradation, the obscenity of what had happened there; I felt, too, the pride of the men and women who had survived the passage, who had survived the horrors Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 188 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 189 of slavery, who had fought against those horrors, and who had kept on fighting through Reconstruction and yet another migration and into the civil rights era and on to the streets of our cities today, now with bullhorns and masks and banners and a raised fist—­this is our DNA, this is our skin.

What I found amazed me. Despite the horrid conditions, there wasn’t a mean spirit there—­not even among the jailers. The poor conditions were due more to a lack of resources than to any meanness of spirit. I was accompanied on my visit by a woman named Femi Adetola. She pays for the women and men’s medicine and food out of her own purse, and it’s no exaggeration to say that she is an angel on Earth and one of my heroes. What I didn’t realize that day was that that visit was the perfect preparation for my subsequent visit to the slave Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 189 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f190 shaka senghor dungeons. Black bodies in captivity—­this is what they look like. I had lived it, but even I still needed reminding. That was on my third day in Ghana; the next day I went to Osu Castle, which houses the slave dungeons. Right above the slave dungeons there’s a quiet, white-­walled church—­small, with just a few pews and a giant crucifix on the wall above two simple chairs. I sat on a pew and found myself in tears as I contemplated the slave traders kneeling on the floor of this church, a floor that was also the ceiling of the dungeon below, where hundreds of souls awaited their terrible fate.

Think of what our culture has given to humanity, and in such circumstances! This is our magic, our ability to transcend darkness with a sure and confident gaze toward whatever light we might be able to discern. In four hundred years, we have grown from the wastelands of slavery to a mountainside, a high point where we can either keep climbing, or—­no, there’s no going back. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 190 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 191 We’re going to climb, you and me and all of us. We are going to stay fully present in our blackness amid the threats and accusations and suspicions; we are going to be the magic, and we are going to recognize the magic in one another, because when we do so . . . ​well, there’s nothing more beautiful. There’s a rhythm in us that is so in tune with nature itself—­it’s in our walk, our dance, our creativity, our voice, our deepest selves. How can we not be filled with joy and appreciation when we recognize that? When you tap into who you are, it’s immeasurable.

IBU R T So many is the answer, DISbecause that pride and dignity are R FO We can never outrun it, nor should we woven into our DNA. OT N ever want to.

This is the way of our community; we are called to reveal our magic despite, and inside of, a profoundly oppressive environment. There are so many opportunities for the narrative of pain to dominate our hearts, yet each day so many of us push away the lure of sorrow for a kind of manic joy, a creativity and kindness that are direct descendants of the broken souls of enslaved people. This choice is what sets us apart; we are forever choosing to recognize the magic of our own selves as a way of building a wall against the other narratives that dictate our place in society. That’s the wizardry of our curiosity; that’s the thing Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 191 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f192 shaka senghor that speaks truth to us, even from our birth—­a birth, lest we forget, into a world that wants to abort us before we’re even conceived. This choice to do magic, to be magical people, to let our curiosity and positivity shine? It’s everywhere, if we only take the time to look. Yes, Sekou, there are men like LeBron James and Jay-­Z and even Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X—­great men all, but they’re out of reach of our day-­to-­day reality.

Unlike me, he S I D he and his brother went grew up in poverty, which was why OR F T to live with their grandmother in Detroit. She was working at NO GM and would come home coughing up fumes from the factory; Calvin couldn’t bear that, and like me, when he looked around, the only people he saw making any money were the older men in the drug trade. So, like me, he got involved, mostly so his younger brothers wouldn’t face the same life he had, and, like mine, his decisions ended in tragedy. One day in September 1988, Calvin and a friend were going about their business in Mount Clemens, a small town northeast of Detroit near the shores of Anchor Bay. The two young men met a connection to buy crack, which they both could Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 192 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 193 then sell. The deal went badly, and Calvin’s friend shot the dealer, killing him. Two years later, Calvin was convicted of the murder, a murder he had not committed, and given a long prison sentence. Calvin hadn’t killed anyone, but the code of the street mandated that he not snitch on the guy who’d actually pulled the trigger. We first met at the Michigan Reformatory—­in solitary in 1993—­then we were together in Adrian, Michigan. Years later we reconnected at Ojibway Correctional Facility, way up on the Michigan-­Wisconsin border, a few miles from Lake ION T U seeing the beauty of Superior. I remember riding up IBthere, R T S northern Michigan as we the Mackinaw Bridge. I was DIcrossed R FO place—­a prison bus—­and as we crossed in the ugliest possible OT N the bridge, I could sense the turmoil where Lakes Michigan and Huron swirled together below me.

Perhaps being but still able to resonate with the OR F T why meeting Calvin became such in that state of mindOwas N a profound moment. We first met without being able to see each other face-­to-­ face. We were in solitary at the Michigan Reformatory in 1993, in one of the oldest cell blocks. I was on the bottom tier; Cal was on a tier above and a couple of cells over. Conversations went back and forth from cell to cell, tier to tier. Some guys would describe their old neighborhoods; some would sing. Sometimes a conversation between two men would become a conversation among many. I had heard Calvin debating passionately with a couple of guys about our responsibilities Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 193 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f194 shaka senghor to our communities—­with so much time to pass, guys were always debating things—­and I felt instantly that he was someone I could connect with. I was still early in my development, reading a lot about Black revolutionaries, but Calvin and I were on the same page about contributing to the communities we’d helped destroy; we were big fans of books about Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey; and we loved all things sports. His presence swelled up into my heart like Lake Superior, immediately a friend and then a best friend. We ended up running into each other in various prisons in the North, and our friendship grew and grew. N TIOin the best way. And U Calvin is as funny as hell; he’s silly RIB ISTand slight, he’s very competiperhaps because he’s D short FORgetting into shit on the basketball court tive.

And that’s because everyone knew that he was the kind of person who’d give you the shirt off his back. In one interview he was quoted as saying “I just resigned myself to the idea that I would have to do this time, so I decided to be the best person I could be.” From the moment we met, I realized that Calvin was a person who served. He was constantly mentoring young men, gathering resources for those who had nothing, and giving words of encouragement to everyone he came across. He taught me so much about compassion—­not compassion Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 194 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 195 as some weakly, soft-­focus thing but as a love born out of real conflict and trauma. The perfect example was this: Calvin informed me that the guy who’d actually committed that murder all those years ago was now in prison with us, and the rule of the yard dictated that his unwillingness to take the blame for the death, thereby damning Calvin to more than two decades in prison for something he hadn’t done, meant he’d have to be dealt with. That was the code by which we lived, and as I was a leader of the yard, the sanction for punishment of this man might well have to come from me. I was livid that that now-­ ION T grown man had devastated Calvin’s IBU life, but Calvin was havR T IS ing none of it. “He wasDsixteen years old, Shaka,” he said to R FO that the fate of the man was in my hands. me one day, realizing OT N “You need to protect him, not punish him.

Each day we would walk the track no matter how cold it was, and I’d tell him about my dreams of being a writer, a father, a man going back to society. It was so important then to create authentic friendships, and it remains one of the most crucial things men must do. My friendship with Calvin created a road map for the deep connections I enjoy today. Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 195 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f196 shaka senghor Everything came full circle when I was released a couple of years before Calvin was let out. One of the first places I went was to Calvin’s mother’s house, to fill her in on how he was doing. That was an immense privilege, but it didn’t take long for me to realize why Calvin was such a great person. His mom made me the biggest breakfast I’ve ever seen and served it with love and compassion for this newly released man. I also got to meet his brother, Tap. As I ate that morning, I thought about the fact that when I’d been convicted, I’d been guilty of the crime. Imagine, then, the horror of being forced into such a dreadful, hopeless, and violent environment for something ION T U Calvin had always been you didn’t even do. I marveled at IBhow R T IS able to be fully present, the time as if he’d done the Dserving R FO crime. And when he was finally released, I was proud to be OT N able to help him navigate the shock of the outside world. Our friendship is now cemented deep into the earth, like the struts N under the Mackinaw Bridge. TIO U B But there was a darker side to Calvin’s TRI acceptance of his S I D he was incarcerated that fate. He had come to believe Rwhile O F T because he had beenOinvolved in the drug trade, there were N really only two outcomes he would’ve faced: a young death or a further spiral downward. Prison, for him, seemed like a second chance. This is something that Calvin and I don’t agree on, though I respect his feelings. Calvin reconciled himself to his condition by telling himself the story that prison saved him from that impending doom, as though those twenty-­four years were justified by the life he had lived in the drug culture. I don’t follow this line of reasoning. To me, if you’re a Black boy growing up in a place where you already feel you’re destined Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 196 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 197 to die before you’re twenty-­one, there’s lots of blame to go around before you start blaming yourself. But I understand Calvin’s position, too. Think for a second about Covid. When it hit, many in our community continued to party and hang out together, even though the virus was carving a terrible canyon through it. For people outside our dangerous street culture, it was the first time their mere existence had been threatened; but for many of us, the virus didn’t seem as serious as an AK-­47 bullet hitting us. Of the top ten things terrifying a young man in a tough neighborhood in America, I’m sorry to tell you thatNCovid doesn’t even TIO U make it onto that list. B RI IST became a chance to escape the For Calvin, then, prison D R FOmake worst of his life a better one, and for that I and many T and O N others are eternally grateful. Calvin has gone on to mentor young Black men who’ve been victims of violence, using a N technique called Trauma-­Informed Care. (Put TIOsimply, this U B kind of care asks not “What’s wrong with TRI this person?” but S I D “What happened to this person?”). OR F T Calvin now worksOto N help young men navigate the aftershocks of the violence they’ve suffered. (How I wish I’d known him after I’d been shot as a young man.) He also helps with obtaining housing and getting appropriate treatment; and always, his humor and grace and intensity are rooted in the streets and prison. Even though he lost twenty-­four years of his life, he always shows up as a gift to other people. This, then, is your uncle Cal, Sekou—­a man of great humor and dignity. Just don’t think about rejecting his jump shot . . . * Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 197 * * 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f198 shaka senghor There are others who live out the DNA of the brave men and women of West Africa. All you have to do is look, and you’ll find them. One is Trabian Shorters. Trabian started out as a leading tech entrepreneur, working his way up to the Knight Foundation, where he was the vice president of communities. At a conference in 1991 (coincidentally the same year I went to prison), a woman named Octavia Wilson challenged Trabian when he trotted out the idea that he’d had no good male role models in his life. This is often a truism of the Black community,Nthat Black men are IO Tthey’re U trouble, or when they’re not trouble, just absent. This B I R T S and in many cases it’s completely is a narrative forced upon DIus, R O untrue: there T areFmillions of great role models, and when that O N woman confronted Trabian, he realized that he’d had one of the best. His grandfather, Reverend Kennis Hutchons, Sr., N pantry, had established a church, fed the hungry with IaOfood T U B refurbished houses, given jobs to people TRInewly released from S I D prison, and provided them transportation to and from work. OR F T Kennis Hutchons was NO a great role model, but Trabian had never publicly identified him as that. Fixated on the fact of his own father’s incarceration, he had fallen back on the stereotype that there were no Black men of stature and inspiration. With that realization, Trabian was (easily) able to start identifying the many Black men who were making a difference in their communities. In his book Reach: 40 Black Men Speak on Living, Leading, and Succeeding, he traced the ways in which this damaging narrative came to pass: with the onslaught of crack in our communities and the War on Drugs, Black men once again became demonized, both in white culture and to Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 198 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 199 some extent within the Black community, too. We were the great threat, and we’re still seen that way. That’s why it’s so easy for a police officer to shoot a young Black man running away; when you’re seen as a threat, there’s only one sure way to end that threat. But it doesn’t have to be that way, and it will take changing one person, one day at a time. Part of that new way of thinking has to come from within: from reframing the narrative we carry around inside and by committing to personal growth. As just one example, early on Trabian issued a challenge in Detroit and Philadelphia to identify great Black male role ION T models from older guys on the Iblock BU who fix bikes to barberR T shop owners who give free DIScuts to people applying for jobs to R FO who cut the grass in the park so that young men and women OT N kids can play there—well, he got more than three thousand entries in just those two cities. What that served to do, aside N from identifying opportunities for investment,IO T was to lift up U B good men and women, and show thatRBlack T I men, especially, S I D can transcend the culture’s stereotypes and live out the full OR F T promise of their heritage. NO From there, Trabian saw an opportunity to invest in communities financially. He eventually left the Knight Foundation to establish Black Male Engagement (BMe), an organization that invests in our communities. But the investment is not quite what you’d think; Trabian and his team don’t wait for someone to show up with an organizational structure and a business plan. Instead, starting in eight different cities, BMe simply decided to invest in the men whose projects added benefit to a community—­things like martial arts schools, bike repair shops, fashion and retail, even yoga classes led by Black Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 199 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f200 shaka senghor men. BMe decided to honor what a community says about the applicant, rather than waiting on structures—­fully formed nonprofits or fully fleshed out business plans—­things that only slow up the process of change. Now BMe operates in cities all across the country, with more than thirty-­five thousand community builders and more than three hundred Black male BMe leaders. Behind it all is Trabian’s key question: “How do we create equitable outcomes for all members of our community?” The numbers are astonishing: the organization has received a full $4 million in grants already. This is just one example of how theNworld is turning; TIO in hand with the U slightly, slowly, but it’s turning. Taken B TRI people awoke to the injuschanges in 2020, whenDsoISmany OR tices in our society, T F well, we should be hopeful; we can afford O N some hope. When I think of hope, I think of Maurice Ashley. Sekou, N you love to play chess, so it’s wonderful to beIO T able to point U B you to a role model who has made it toRthe T I very apex of that S I Dchess grand master. He’s a world. Maurice is the first Black OR F T brilliant strategic thinker, NO and what’s more, he’s thought his way to the top. He hasn’t written top-­ten songs or broken any sports records, both of which I wish I could have done—­or any of the other things our culture expects of Black men who are successful. No, he’s used the power of his mind to break through in a completely different way. And there are so many others, men and women you can always turn to for guidance, for support, and for inspiration. They were there for me when I was no one; they’re still there for me as I move forward in my journey to inspire and change. I want you to think about their service, their commitment to Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 200 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 201 change, and their love—­as with so much else in these letters to you, their work comes down to love, always. It’s the one thing that conquers all. I know this from dark experience; I have lived in a place with no love, and now I live in the love of these men and women. One of the best you can turn to is Brittany Barnett, a corporate attorney who works pro bono on the side to get people out of prison. Her mother had been incarcerated, so she knew the price families paid, and eventually she created two nonprofits: the Buried Alive Project, which works to dismantle life-­without-­parole sentences, and Girls Embracing ION T Mothers, which seeks to empower IBUgirls whose mothers are in R T prison. She also founded DISXVI Capital Partners and Milena R FO help formerly incarcerated people make Reign, both ofTwhich O N their way in the world. If you can’t find Brittany, contact Susan Burton. She did N six separate stints in jail but was able to break TIOthe cycle of U B addiction and incarceration and went on TRIto create A New Way S I D tirelessly to help women of Life Reentry Project, whichRworks O F T lives. In the beginning, she simply leaving prison createOnew N went to the LA bus station and found women she could take into her home. It’s no exaggeration to call her a modern-­day Harriet Tubman for her work saving women who have led such difficult lives. Then there’s Jessica Jackson from #cut50, who is now the chief advocacy officer for the Reform Alliance, an organization that works to end the abuse of probation and parole. Each of these women could have lost their career with the work they do—­all it takes is one tragic story or an unpopular political stance to cause society to turn on organizations that work on the margins. But despite the risks, they Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 201 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f202 shaka senghor have committed to serve the most vulnerable population, and their work saves lives every single day. And there’s always Scott Budnick—­yeah, that Scott Budnick, the producer of the Hangover movies, who quit filmmaking for a while to create the Anti-­Recidivism Coalition (ARC), thereby risking his career by working to free young people from prison. But the intersection of Scott’s two worlds has changed lives from both sides. As he told the Hollywood Reporter, “Oftentimes, we have an A-­list director . . . ​sitting on a couch with two people that just got out of prison that are looking for housing or jobs or going to college or a menION T torship or therapy or whateverIit may be.

FLewis, think about Sam OT N He spent twenty-­four years in prison but now goes back into prisons to be a mentor. Imagine that, going back into such N terrible places to change lives. TIO U IByou so much about And then there’s Van Jones. I could R T tell S I D poignant moments in our him, but here’s one of the most OR F T friendship. Remember NOwhen I told you earlier about not being able to get into the White House? Well, here’s what happened inside that day: My not being able to get in caused Van to very carefully tear into the folks at the conference, saying they shouldn’t be listening to him, they should be listening to me, and what a disgrace it was that I was barred from the building. Angie Martinez told me about it, and I watched a video of his address later—­his voice was breaking; he looked so stricken, as though that was the greatest kind of insult. It was his chance to change policy and hearts and minds, and he Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 202 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 203 did so by focusing on what was happening to me outside the building. This is love; this is compassion; this is Van. You should look up to all these people. Most of all, you must internalize their successes, their struggles, their ability to overcome, and take that power forward with you in life. They are proof that we can overcome anything; that the blood and sweat and shit and tears of our African ancestors mean something. They’re the essence of the magic of us—­ undeniable, physical, sacrosanct, profound, and beautiful. They have created an American beauty, of which you are the latest and most beautiful expression.NTo quote a T-­shirt IO Twildest U I once saw, “You are your ancestor’s dream.” In fact, B I R T IS no ancestor could haveDdreamed the wonder of you.

Here’s what hapYou were just a baby D R pened: T FO O N “uncle” Fame has been an entrepreneur Your since he was fourteen years old—­doing this, doing N that, making this, making that. Eventually, TIOhe got U B to create into making T-­shirts and was starting TRI S I D quite the buzz in Detroit. His empire would evenOR F T tually stretch to three retail stores called Three NO Thirteen. I met him when I was writing for a local newspaper called The Michigan Citizen a few months after I left prison. At the time he was building out his store in the heart of the northwest side of Detroit, and I quickly fell in with him. I liked his energy, his vibe, and he believed in me as a person, so we became partners. I opened a bookstore inside his shop and hustled every single book I could into the hands of an unsuspecting public. We were two poor Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 205 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f206 shaka senghor entrepreneurs. Our lunch every day was hot dogs that we barbecued outside the shop on a little red grill. One day Fame and I had a conversation about supporting the community. I thought it was important to provide resources—­everything from free food to free books—­as part of our business practices, but Fame didn’t see how it would generate revenue for either of us. He and I got into a real debate about it. He was a businessman first and foremost, and I was more of a social entrepreneur. Though Fame was dedicated to the community, he was also a designer and artist, and oftentimes his focus was on creating the next great ION T look rather than organizing a Ifood BU giveaway. But I believed R T S the community to support us; it wasn’t enough to just DIask R FO we needed toTreciprocate if we wanted to create anything O N meaningful. It took convincing, but once Fame bought in, he was all N about it. We decided to put on what we called TIO“Joy Day.” U B (We were on Joy Road, after all.) We figured TRI we’d try to get S I D the whole community to come together to enjoy life for one OR F T whole Saturday. NO And off we went. We handed out flyers all over the neighborhood and then set out to solicit support from every store on that stretch. We hit up the banks for a contribution (they donated their parking lot), we got food and liquor from the stores up and down the street, and we brought in face painters and made cupcakes. The kids were so excited—­“Three days to go!” they’d shout to us, then “Two more days!,” then “Tomorrow!” I decided to pass out as many books as I could (I ended up giving away hundreds of books that day), and we managed to feed four hundred people hot dogs and chips Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 206 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 207 while giving away a week’s worth of groceries to two hundred families. We even remembered to tell the guys in the hood that whatever beefs they had needed to be put aside on Joy Day—­and no drug deals, either. Everyone agreed. The support of our community found its fullest expression that day from Cal and Tee, two barbers in the neighborhood. When Fame had asked them to participate, I hadn’t been surprised when they’d told him they couldn’t. Saturday was their busiest day, and Joy Day happened just before back to school. For men working on tips, a good Saturday made the difference between paying a bill and not N paying a bill. It was IO T U was getting rich cutting a matter of survival for them; no IBone R T hair, so there were no hard DISfeelings from Uncle Fame and me. R FinOthe afternoon, without warning, a squad Then suddenly, OT N of barbers, all dressed in their capes and carrying their clippers, strode out of their shops onto Joy Road and proceeded N to offer a free haircut to all the kids who couldn’t TIO afford one. U B Cal and Tee had seen the kids having fun TRIand decided to close S I D head out to offer love and their shops, corral their staff,Rand O F T a number one all over. NO Since that first Joy Day, Fame has lost his skepticism and gone on to become a key influencer of Detroit culture. He’s opened his stores and kept them open in an unpopular place; and he’s evolved into an incredible thought leader with a brand that people stand behind. But more than those accomplishments, he’s taught me so many lessons about raising children. Fame is raising two kids as a single dad, all the while running his store. Watching the way his younger daughter was intimately involved in his business, I realized that I needed to share my work life with you so you could understand who I Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 207 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f208 shaka senghor was becoming. I also learned how to balance work and fatherhood and the importance of taking time out for myself when either of those things became overwhelming. Our friendship isn’t the grunts and sports talk that many men share; it is deep, through tough times and good. I hope you will remember this scene, Sekou: a bunch of barbers in their capes, striding like an army of love along Joy Road on the northwest side of Detroit—­a place that had once thrived with music and cars but had now fallen into disrepair—­all to give dignity and a fade to the children of Detroit. Those men are nameless now; their act of love is out ION T there in the wind somewhere but rooted, too, in the commuIBU R T nity, in its sense of shared DISpurpose and struggles overcome. R O Fessence That was the of Joy Day: you ate chips, got your OT N face painted, and eventually fell asleep amid the jangle of voices and laughter and full bellies and smart hairdos that day N in Detroit.

We need OR F to create space inOaTworld where a child’s curiosity is N nurtured, seen as an opportunity to learn the next biggest lesson or to create the next big thing. One day I was browsing Facebook when I came upon a post that a friend, a poet named T. Miller, had written. Her nephew had just tested the waterproof capabilities of the new iPhone she had given him as a gift. The phone was ruined, even though it claimed to be waterproof. She was asking her followers what she should do. Most of the comments encouraged her to punish Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 209 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f210 shaka senghor her nephew, but I wrote, “He was simply getting empirical data, as any scientist might.” (Maybe Apple should hire him.) My comment reflects what I think we should do when it comes to Black kids in general and Black boys specifically: we have to give them the room to be curious without unduly punishing them for being children. A few years ago, Sekou sat down next to me and asked if it was okay that he was drawing on his clothes with a Sharpie. He was beaming with pride as he continued to graffiti his expensive new jogging pants. “Sure,” I said, “but you then gotta wear them.” I took a video of Sekou and sent it to his ION T mother, and we laughed about Iwhat BU would have happened to R T ISkids. If there was one thing I could us if we’d been that bold Das R O we parent Black boys, it would be this: change about T theFway O N giving them permission to figure out the world. Instead of this openness, Black children are too often being N threatened with being “put out.” If you can’tIO T abide by the U B rules of my house, they are told, you can TRI get the fuck out. If S I D a bit about it in front of a you were a comedian and youRdid O F T Black audience, the O Ncrowd would be laughing and clapping, nodding to themselves that, yup, they heard that. These are our mothers, our grandmothers, our fathers, our grandfathers saying this. When I told Oprah about my childhood, she told me she’d heard the same. Whooping is so normal in the Black community. Oftentimes I’ll get into a debate about it, and someone will make light of it. My answer is always the same: What would you do if your spouse came and woke you up in the middle of the night and whooped your ass with a belt for not doing the dishes? See? Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 210 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 211 These are not rare stories in our community. That’s why stand-­up comedians make a living telling them in a funny way. But you, Sekou, will never face such a trauma; not at my hands, never. I will never traumatize your body—­not just because it’s wrong but because it sets up the normalization that this will happen to you as a Black man. Already, the Black body is not our own; it is controlled by the state, by corrections officers and police officers and all the other tools of oppressive society. Our culture has set us up to be inherently disconnected from our bodies. In prison I was superresistant to stripNsearches, and I got IO Toften U into trouble a lot because of it—­ I refused to spread B I R T S because I refused to be further. Eventually I DIdehumanized R FOwith an officer about it and realized how had a conversation OT N dehumanizing and degrading it is even for them. Imagine if your job for 40 hours a week was to look at assholes of various N after shades, various colors, shaved and unshaved. Eventually, TIO U B 160 hours a month of looking at assholes, TRI you must surely S I D become what you do. OR F T Such are the horrors NO of my life. Imagine, then, the joy of you just randomly coming up and giving me a hug. Sometimes I need a hug, too, like the little boy I was never allowed to be. I think about when I was growing up in the hood and seeing young boys who never got hugs. Even in my own home, my dad wasn’t a big hugger. It was something he had to navigate as a young father—­he had joined the air force when he was around seventeen, so he had moved into a hard-­nosed culture early on. His father hadn’t been around much, either. Each year, though, his ability to show affection grew stronger, even when I was in prison. Through letters, he exhibited affection Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 211 8/20/21 10:45 AM \f212 shaka senghor that landed just short of actual hugs. When I see my dad now, we immediately hug; my dream is for you both to be able to say the same for as long as I am alive. This is what young boys are missing. I first noticed this in prison when I was teaching a class called “Houses of Healing.” In that class, one of the most powerful moments was when the men would hug each other (they’d been sharing their traumas). Now I’m fortunate to see it every day with you—­a hug can change a bad moment into something redemptive. Sekou, you fell over on your birthday and hurt yourself, but when we hugged it out, it calmed you, andNthe day was saved. O TIyears, U Jay, when I came home after nineteen we hugged, and B I R T hugging you felt like hugging DIS the little boy in me. There’s a R FO from men that they can’t get from their love that boysTneed O N mothers. They need those hugs, they need their hair tousled, they need to sit at the feet of men who can share wisdom with N them. That’s what I want to create. TIO U B Men are as complex as women thinkRthey T I are. It’s time we S I Dto boy, boy to boy. honored that, man to man, man OR F T If you go throughO N every possible way to die in America, we can tick every box: we lead on gun violence, suicide, cancer, heart disease—­even Covid didn’t let us slip in those evil rankings. This isn’t to dismiss the trauma our society inflicts on Black women; it just explains why this cycle persists. So we are left with little more than a survival mentality. You want to know why Black men work so hard and fight so hard and hit so hard in football, say? Why that intensity on every play? This is trauma. No, the defensive line on an NFL team is not generally playing with joy. It should be the Seng_9780593238011_all_3p_r1.e.indd 212 8/20/21 10:45 AM \fLetters to the Sons of Society 213 pinnacle, making it to “the Big Dance.” But this is survival, not joy. This is what I want you never to know, this feeling that all you’re doing is surviving, that your body is not your own, that you can’t get love from the men in your life. I want you to flower, to expand, to taste every last drop of what the world has to offer. Yes, you will see overreactions, brutality, and the look on the face of white culture that may one day want to kill you because it’s afraid of the imaginary ghost of who you can be. But you will have my love, Sekou, and the love of other men around you, and we will honor you, raise you up, and let ION T you be fully human.

I lost twenty years to a system that thought I was irredeemable; but somehow, through literature and letters and words, I was able to find a way out of the darkness into the light of this past decade.
